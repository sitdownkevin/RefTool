However, little is known under what conditions these programs are more or less effective. We provide a contingency framework that considers various design, retailer, and country characteristics that can moderate an LP's impact on a retailer's sales productivity. We test the framework across a large sample of 358 grocery banners from a broad cross-section of 27 western and eastern European countries. We find a positive effect of the more basic LP variant that offers direct and immediate rewards. This positive effect, however, disappears when retailers operate a more complex progressive-reward system and when they are part of a multivendor program. An LP's impact also differs between retailers and countries: it is lower when operated by discounters, and higher in countries that are more individualistic and long-term oriented, and where fewer competitors also carry a loyalty program. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Based on the psycho-evolutionary theory of emotions, the theory of embarrassment and the literature on losing face, this study explores the effect of status demotion on customers' intentions to switch service providers in the Chinese context. By doing so, the study examines how feelings of frustration and social discomfort mediate the relationship between status demotion and the switching intentions of Chinese airline HLP members. It further examines how relationship age and gender moderate the link between status demotion and feelings of frustration and social discomfort. Three hundred and forty-seven active members of airline HLPs in China participated in a structured survey. The data collected were then analyzed using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling. The results show that status demotion causes members to experience feelings of frustration and social discomfort, which further lead them to switch service providers. These effects of status demotion on frustration and social discomfort are found to be higher (lower) among the members with longer (shorter) relationship age and male (female) members. The findings of the study have significant theoretical and managerial implications. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

While the importance of shopping momentum, i.e., buyers continuing to shop, is known, few studies have examined how mobile promotions can incentivize buyers to sustain their shopping momentum in a mall. This study examines how a mall operator targets buyers in its loyalty program with a real-time message (RTM) to encourage them to sustain their shopping momentum and spend more at the next retailer. We use a quasi-experimental design and show that the RTM has a stronger effect on heavy than light buyers. Specifically, moderate and heavy buyers are more likely to respond favorably to RTMs by sustaining shopping momentum and increasing spending at the next retailer. In contrast, the RTM has no effect on shopping momentum of light buyers, and if they continue to shop, they lower their subsequent spending. The study has important implications for retailers using mobile applications to target buyers with relevant real-time promotions to achieve desired outcomes. © 2022 New York University"

To build an understanding of the phenomenon, the current research examines activity streaks. With a theories-in-use approach, we first define an activity streak. We then differentiate activity streaks from other forms of patterned behavior, including winning and lucky streaks, habits, and collections. With survey, experimental, and field data, we investigate factors that impact one’s commitment to an activity streak. We find that streak commitment is a positive function of individual differences, including the activity’s identity relevance to the actor, beliefs about self-improvement resulting from the activity, and the actor’s personal need for structure, and marketer-controlled elements, including structuring the streak as a daily (versus cumulative) task, presenting the streak as a short-term (versus indefinite) goal, and allowing the actor to keep the streak private (versus sharing with others). These findings lead to a deeper understanding of streaks, provide practical implications for marketers, and highlight opportunities for future research. © Academy of Marketing Science 2023."

One main finding is that customers’ perceived value of a loyalty program has significant direct and moderating effects on chain loyalty, and the moderation effects are chain dependent.

Quickly becoming popular for upselling the premium rooms that may otherwise go unsold, standby upgrade—an availability-based, discounted premium room upgrade—is a prominent example. However, customers, in particular loyalty members, may become knowledgeable about standby upgrades through repeated interactions with this technology, and act strategically, that is, initially choose a standard room with the expectation of being offered a premium room discount through standby upgrades. Consequently, while enjoying the benefits of this program, hotels may face the potential cannibalization of premium sales due to such strategic behavior and need to adjust their pricing accordingly. Using a major hotel chain's 16-month booking and standby upgrades data, we empirically investigate the existence and extent of strategic customers in the context of standby upgrades. After showing preliminary evidence of potential strategic behavior, we develop a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the percentage of customers who are strategic. This estimator captures the sequential nature of customer decision-making for standby upgrades (booking decision, clicking the standby upgrades offer, and requesting an upgrade) through a Sequential Logit Model. We find evidence of strategic behavior in three (out of eight) hotels examined. Considering both a weak-form and a strong-form strategic behavior, our estimates suggest that 12%–42% of the loyalty customers act strategically in these three properties. We then propose a new pricing policy to help hoteliers maximize their premium room revenues from direct bookings and standby upgrade requests. This policy recommends a discounted full price, but also a higher standby upgrade price for loyalty customers, which can bring a revenue improvement of up to 19% over a policy ignoring the strategic behavior and 34% over a policy assuming that all customers are strategic—two reasonable benchmarks without an estimate of the fraction of strategic customers. Our research, thus, provides insights for technology managers on the potential customer behavioral challenges that a hotel may face with the adoption of a disruptive digital technology, and how existing policies may need to be adjusted for the technology to be successful. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc."

We call this phenomenon the ""one-away effect""because we find that when consumers are, for example, one stamp away from completing a punch card loyalty program, they value the card more than a completed card. This is because their valuation of the one-away card is influenced by their anticipation of merely completing the card, which generates its own utility, apart from the card's end-reward (a free coffee). To wit, the prospective utility of performing the final action that fulfills completion increases consumers' valuation of the one-away card. Our findings suggest that consumers are motivated to complete goals, tasks, and sets not only to obtain their end-rewards, but also because merely completing things is intrinsically motivating and can be a goal in and of itself. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the one-away effect, as well as the general notion of mere completion.  © 2023 The Author(s).

VAT-free promotions are a recently adopted form of price promotions where consumers are exempted from paying the VAT amount across almost all products in the assortment during a limited number of days. They are typically organized once per year and surrounded by a large amount of media attention from the involved retailer. To test the effects of this promotion on store and category sales, and investigate the differences between loyalty program (LP) members and non-LP members, the authors use scanner data from a Dutch durable goods retailer across a range of categories. The results show that VAT-free promotions positively impact store performance. Moreover, the findings indicate that more non-LP members are attracted to the store and that they increase the amount they spend in the store. While LP members also spend more in the store, this increase in shopping basket size does not compensate for the significant drop in the number of LP members that visit the store, leading to an overall decrease in sales coming from LP members during VAT-free days. We furthermore find that the positive effect of VAT-free promotions for non-LP members (rather than LP members) generalizes across all investigated categories. Our results provide key insights for retailers and direct marketers with regard to the effectiveness of VAT-free promotions in order to strategically segment the customer base. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Design/methodology/approach: Four scenario-based experiments were conducted in the customer demotion context of an airline’s hierarchical loyalty program. A total of 796 customers recruited from a survey panel participated in the study. Findings: The results reveal that customers in top-tier demotion significantly increase their willingness to restore lost status and loyalty intentions when a short evaluation period (vs a long evaluation period) is given. Further, customers in bottom-tier demotion improve their willingness to restore and, in turn, their loyalty intentions more with a gain-focused communication style than with a loss-focused communication style. Willingness to restore lost status plays a mediating role in the process by which an appropriate match between demotion type and evaluation period type/communication styles leads to higher loyalty intentions. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the research stream on customer demotion by examining how to execute customer demotion to mitigate its detrimental effects and facilitate demoted customers’ approach motivation and behavioral intentions, a critical but understudied topic that has been ignored by researchers. Practical implications: Managers are advised to offer customized customer status evaluation periods and communication styles for top-tier and bottom-tier demoted customers to effectively promote their willingness to restore lost status and loyalty intentions. Originality/value: This study is among the first to explore the possible varying effects of differential demotion policy and communication style on different tiers of customers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

As the pandemic has influenced all walks of life, including university performance and, as a result, the relations between the university and the alumni. The paper also addresses the impact of COVID-19 on selected alumni loyalty programs. The critical literature research was enriched with the analysis of loyalty programs of selected 15 universities under the EU-sponsored “Forge of Professionals 7” project, with the follow-up analysis of 2 universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, alumni loyalty determinants were developed. Managing alumni loyalty could be divided into three groups: alumni-based, university-based, and mixed. The most important factor influencing alumni loyalty is not the organization of alumni loyalty management, but the communication tools used by a university. The implementation of the results can bring numerous benefits to the universities: they can enjoy great flexibility in managing alumni relations systems. The university willing to strengthen alumni relations must take this from a strategic point of view. Establishing flourishing alumni relations is always a long process, requiring bold planning and consistent execution. Its value is a practical approach to the management of the relationship between a university and its alumni, and as such, it can greatly contribute to improving policy and practice in higher education. © 2022, Czestochowa University of Technology.

Theoretical work suggests that if switching costs are significant, firms should charge lower prices in the early periods of a program to boost market share, and increase prices in later periods, to take advantage of the “lock-in” effect. However, it is not clear whether these costs soften or exacerbate price competition. Using a large database of gas stations’ prices in the Italian market, we study fuel prices in early and late periods of loyalty programs: the sharp price changes adopted by gas stations affiliated with the program during the introduction and termination dates of the program allow us to establish the causal relationship between the program and the pricing behavior of gas stations. We find evidence that gas stations affiliated with the program increase prices in later periods of the program, as predicted by theory. The higher prices of affiliated stations lead to an increase in prices, on average, across all other stations competing in the local market. We also find that affiliated stations reduce their prices in early periods of the program; however, this evidence is less conclusive, as our data cannot exclude other factors explaining the price reduction. We discuss implications for managers and policy makers. © 2023, INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences. All rights reserved."

However, little is known about how customers' cultural values shape their satisfaction in response to loyalty programs. Such knowledge is important because it allows marketers to identify cultural segments that may be more or less likely to respond favorably to loyalty programs, and hence increase the effectiveness of such programs. In the current research, we propose that power distance perception — defined as the extent to which people observe power disparities in society — positively influences satisfaction of customers who hold loyalty status, but negatively influences satisfaction of customers who do not hold loyalty status with a firm. In contrast, power distance values — defined as the extent to which people endorse power disparities in society — negatively influences satisfaction of customers who hold loyalty status, but positively influences satisfaction of customers who do not hold loyalty status with a firm. A quasi-field study and several lab experiments support these propositions, shed light on the underlying mechanisms, and rule out alternative explanations.

Although academic research on loyalty programs has examined the extent to which consumers succeed or fail in reward–goal pursuit, insufficient attention has been paid to the consequences of such successes or failures. Addressing this gap, we draw upon research on goal pursuit and counterfactual thinking to examine the effect of goal completion magnitude on individuals’ effort toward achieving subsequent goals, and how maintenance versus attainment goal types moderate this relationship. Analyzing flight activities from 5719 members of a major airline’s frequent flyer program, we found that (1) individuals who failed (vs. succeeded) at achieving an attainment goal will put more (vs. less) effort into subsequent goal pursuit than individuals who failed (vs. succeeded) at fulfilling a maintenance goal; (2) a linear effect of goal achievement magnitude on future goal pursuit effort under the maintenance goal, such that the more one completed his/her previous goal, the more effort he/she will invest in the subsequent goal cycle; and (3) a reverse U-shaped effect of goal achievement magnitude under the attainment goal, such that substantial goal achievement in the previous goal cycle creates a surprising hampering effect (i.e., close-but-no-cigar effect) on subsequent goal pursuit. Instead, moderate achievement of the previous goal leads to the most effort invested in subsequent goal pursuit. These results and the proposed underlying processes are further explored in a lab experiment.

The results confirmed that gamified loyalty programs (vs. conventional ones) increased consumer loyalty toward loyalty programs which in turn enhanced consumers' participation intention and app download intention.

In particular, this paper highlights that true impact (defined as being meaningful change) can only be achieved when the research findings are operationalized and deployed as a business solution. Design/methodology/approach: The approach taken in this paper is to challenge the traditional paradigm where field research is led by academics and places the corporate stakeholder at the centre of the research, where they have a leading role. This involves identifying, selecting, collaborating and engaging with key corporate stakeholders early in the research project, thus gaining their input and support so that the research recommendations secure the necessary funding to be successfully deployed. Findings: The authors highlight two research projects focused on tier demotion and disengagement and deceitful behaviour driven from incentivise and gamifying learning. A new tier demotion process involving a highly customised customer care charter has been deployed and resulted in a re-engagement rate of 81% from those channel partners who were demoted (a rise from 40%). Deceitful behaviour detection tools were also deployed, resulting in 4,300 possible deceptive cases being investigated and resolved in Year 1, reducing to 451 in Year 6. Research limitations/implications: The change in research approach where field research places the corporate stakeholder at the centre of the research will add to the complexity of the research project, impact on timelines and introduce more stakeholders into the research team, which may have wider implications to the original research goal. Practical implications: This transition will require academics to know more about their corporate partner, the corporate landscape, adding to the complexity of the research project and cede some control over the project. Originality/value: Whilst academic research contributes to a body of theoretical concepts, equally important is bringing to life the research findings to show actual impact and meaningful change within the research setting. The present research approach has since been applied to multiple channel loyalty programmes across numerous industries increasing revenue and driving the success of the respective programmes. One key learning would be to engage more corporate stakeholders as part of the research project from the outset.

Using a unique longitudinal data set provided by a large global hotel chain, we aim to understand the drivers behind CSS participation and, ultimately, behind online review posting in response to a prompt at the end of a survey. We employ the Hidden Markov model (HMM) to analyze how a customer's engagement state changes as a function of previous managerial responses, loyalty program membership, and satisfaction. The results reveal that customers have a greater tendency to transfer to higher engagement states if managers have responded to prior customer surveys.

We report positive effects of push messages on spending, and even stronger effects on redemption, relative to a control group not receiving such messages. Due to the savings dynamics, the total spending impact is larger for messages sent early on rather than late in the program, while the opposite holds for the total number of stamps redeemed.

In this paper, we examine the impact of a promotion on purchase and reward redemption in a reward program in which consumers can partially cover the cost of a free reward with their money. The literature on reward programs suggests a positive reinforcement caused by reward redemption, whereas the literature on promotion provides different views regarding the existence of a postpromotion dip. Using data from a major retailer’s reward program, we verify that such a promotion attracted customers with less transaction activity and shorter tenure. Interestingly, consumers using the promotion increased their preference for hedonic rewards compared to their previously observed behavior. This change in preference persisted after the promotion ended. Overall, the promotion significantly increased the number of redemptions but generated a negative impact on subsequent consumer behavior by decreasing purchase incidence and quantity.

Based on several thousand social media posts connected to both loyalty and non-loyalty program sales, we show that relational and intellectual content have greater effects in driving sales to loyalty program members while behavioral content drives greater sales to non-loyalty program members. These findings improve our understanding of the financial outcomes of social media tactics, providing researchers and marketers with an understanding of the differences in responses across customer groups and a framework to optimize social media content. © 2022, Academy of Marketing Science."

Chatbots are machine-intelligent conversational agents (ICAs) employing natural language to provide data and services as user interfaces (Brandtzaeg & Følstad, 2017). ICAs have recently gained popularity due to AI, offering social capabilities (Adam et al., 2020). Chatbots act as brand endorsers, improve social presence, anthropomorphism, reinforce positive eWom (Sudhakar, 2021), and reduce the costs of implementing loyalty programs (Adam et al., 2020). However, not all ICAs implementations are effective because of a lack of understanding of factors influencing performance and perception (Chouki et al., 2020). Studies in this regard propose approaches including (1) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for usage factors (Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020; Radziwill & Benton, 2017); (2) emotional and motivations in consumer experience (Nordheim et al., 2019; Zarouali et al. 2018); (3) social presence (De Cicco et al., 2020; Toader et al., 2020); or, (4) anthropomorphism (Chen & Lin, 2021; Han, 2021; Ling et al., 2021; Roy & Naidoo, 2021). However, there is a research gap proposing an integrative model of ICA acceptance. Furthermore, no model considers the brand perception impact. This study provides a conceptual model for adopting branded ICA. We start with bibliometric analysis around the relation between ICAs and brands by using Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). Next, we identified latent categories and emerging theories from 2085 papers applying Machine Learning (ML) (LDA and DTM) (Blei & Lafferty, 2006; Blei et al., 2003). Then, we conduct a comprehensive review of 33 empirical research works relating to the continuance or adoption intention of ICAs, eWom, social media, or websites (Kitchenham et al., 2009). As a result, four main topic clusters emerged: (1) social media, consumer & brand management; (2) ICAs, AI & technology Acceptance; (3) Design & User Experience, and (4) ICA’s on e-commerce. Two topics emerge as current streams: ICAs on Augmented Reality (ARIT) and ICAs on social media. Finally, two emerging topics: (1) Privacy & Trust; (2) Social ICAs. Finally, this study provides an integrative conceptual model. As antecedents, two factors appear Brand trust and ICA anthropomorphism. Three elements are relational: social presence, response consistency, and response quality. As consequences: (1) Perceived usefulness, (2) Perceived experience, and (3) Patronage (intention to use and recommend). As implications, this study contributes to human-computer interaction theories and opens new paradigms in social relationships theories. We also provide a new perspective on brand communication. In turn, we provide insights into the concepts that influence the successful implementation of ICAs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This article integrates discussions of service relationships and models of service variability. Leveraging a field study, the authors track over 12,000 experiences across 3,084 consumers for a 2-year period and model the impact of variability in these experiences on consumer relationships. The results reveal variability in a service relationship can significantly impact consumer confidence and that the nature of this relationship is nonlinear, revealing that small variations in quality will have strong effects on confidence and that these effects plateau as variability increases. Despite these overall effects, we also demonstrate that the positive benefits of service improvement strategies can offset these effects. Finally, in a second study, the results suggest firms can insulate themselves from the effects of variability by encouraging consumer involvement in relational investments (i.e., loyalty programs) that provide consumers with both interpersonal (i.e., status) and economic resources (i.e., points). Taken together, the results demonstrate that consumers integrate evaluations across transactions when evaluating a service provider, thus focusing on a single transaction, in isolation, may not accurately capture consumers’ perceptions of the service relationship. © The Author(s) 2020."

However, little is known about whether status demotion engenders two widely recognised behavioural intentions: revenge and avoidance. This study aims to make up this gap by examining the effects of status demotion on customers’ revenge and avoidance intentions. The underlying mechanism and boundary conditions of these effects are also explored. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted to test the hypotheses. Study 1 was conducted using a structured survey from 347 active HLP members/customers of Chinese airlines. Study 2 used an online experiment amongst 268 active HLP airline customers in Australia. Partial least squares-based structural equation modelling and Hayes’ (2013) PROCESS macro were used for data analysis. Findings: The results of Study 1 show that status demotion increases customers’ revenge and avoidance intentions simultaneously. Meanwhile, these effects are more significant for demoted customers with an external locus of causality than those with an internal locus of causality and demoted customers with higher entitlement tend to possess more revenge intentions than avoidance intentions. Study 2 further identified perceived inequity as a mechanism, which links status demotion to revenge and avoidance intentions of demoted customers. Research limitations/implications: This study examines demoted customers’ revenge and avoidance intentions amongst Chinese and Australian airline travellers. Future research may focus on actual behaviour and test the current study’s model in cross-cultural and cross-industry settings. Practical implications: Managers should deal with demotion decisions carefully as the failure to manage outraged customers may weaken customer-company relationships. Originality/value: This study extends the existing literature on relationship marketing and HLPs by offering a better understanding of how and under what conditions status demotion elicits customers’ intentions for revenge and avoidance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The purpose of this paper is thus to identify the main factors that explain the cancellation of motor insurance policies by individual customers, considering the influence of intermediaries on their decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The data used in this research is based on a sample of 3,500 insurance policies that lapsed during the period of analysis between January and July 2017, against another sample of 3,500 policies that did not lapse, from a major insurance company in Portugal. Binary logistic regression was used for data analysis, using IBM SPSS software. Findings: Aggressive tactics by insurance companies for customer acquisition may induce the cancellation of insurance policies. More valuable customers, the policies with higher premiums and recent claims, as well as the ancillary intermediaries and agents, are determinants of insurance cancellation. Conversely, the payment of policies by direct debit and without instalments reduces the probability of cancellations. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is the restriction on data access. Insurance companies are significantly resistant to sharing their customer data – including with academic researchers – even in an anonymised form. Practical implications: The paper highlights internal and external practices of insurance companies that should be reformulated to significantly improve their performance regarding product cancellation, related to customer information management, mistrust behaviours related to stakeholders and new value propositions that deepen the relationships with intermediaries. Originality/value: This research developed a framework with which to identify the factors that are mainly associated with motor insurance cancellation and to predict its likelihood. © 2021, Manuel Leiria, Efigénio Rebelo and Nelson deMatos.; 研究目的: 保險業一向未能有效地留住客戶，故業內不斷努力建立並維繫與客戶長久的關係。因此、本文擬確定個人客戶終止其汽車保單的因素；研究過程中、會考慮中介人對客戶作有關決定的影響 。 研究的設計/方法/理念: 本研究所使用的數據、為基於一個涵蓋3500份期滿終止保單的樣本、並以之與另一涵蓋3500份沒有終止保單的樣本相比，樣本均來自葡萄牙一家大型保險公司。期滿終止保單之樣本、乃於2017年1月至同年7月這個研究進行期間内期滿終止的。研究使用了二元羅吉斯迴歸來分析數據，並應用了IBM SPSS 數據分析軟件。 研究結果: 保險公司為贏得客戶所採用的積極進取策略可能導致客戶終止其保單。保單終止的決定因素包括更多有價值的客戶、保險費較高的保單、最近的索賠和輔助的中介及代理。反之，以自動扣帳方式及以非分期付款形式繳付保單則會減低終止保單的機會。 研究的原創性/價值: 本研究發展了一個框架、以確定與客戶終止其保單有關聯的主要因素，並預計客戶終止保單的可能性。本文亦強調了保險公司須重新制定其內部與外部的做法，以能大幅改善其與產品取消有關的績效，而這些產品取消涉及客戶信息管理、與持份者有關的不信任行為、以及能深化與中介人之關係的新價值主張。 © 2021, Manuel Leiria, Efigénio Rebelo and Nelson deMatos."

One commonly practiced loyalty program is the award of points. Previous research has shown numerous benefits of point redemptions for retailers, such as improving customers’ attitudes toward the retailer (Smith and Sparks 2009), boosting customers’ spending (Taylor and Neslin 2005), and increasing shopping frequency (Henderson et al. 2011). However, researchers found that consumers tend to stockpile reward points in loyalty programs, and the majority of the loyalty points are unredeemed (Bijmolt et al. 2010). To encourage point redemption and cultivate customer loyalty through rewards, marketers use different types of promotion. These promotions include point-plus-cash promotions (PPC), which allow customers to combine their points with cash (Montoya and Flores 2019), and linear loyalty programs, which do not require a minimum amount in point redemption (Stourm et al. 2015). Stockpiling in these loyalty programs is not rewarding, and consumers have to forgo the time value of money for any delayed redemptions. Nonetheless, point stockpiling persists even in these programs (Stourm et al. 2015). In this research, employing a dataset from a popular multi-vendor linear loyalty program in South Korea, we show that members in loyalty programs behave differently in their point stockpiling behavior. We identify four customer segments: (1) heavy purchasers with light point redemptions, (2) light purchasers with light point redemptions, (3) heavy purchasers with heavy point redemptions, and (4) light purchasers with heavy point redemptions. We find substantial heterogeneity in customer’ point accumulation behavior among the four segments. This finding differs from the traditional view that point stockpiling behavior is common across the consumer population. Also, we find that the difference in customers’ stockpiling behavior has a differential impact on their variety-seeking behavior. Specifically, members who redeem less often are more variety-seeking when they accumulate points than members who redeem more often. To marketing managers who consider introducing new products in the loyalty program, our finding is important because it provides insights into which customer groups are more accepting of new alternatives than other segments as the stock of their points increases. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

A strong super-application has gained popularity and sustained customer demand due to Indonesia's smartphone industry expansion. To achieve this objective, a quantitative-qualitative approach utilizing Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) and interviews was employed. Ten-fold indicators determined the sample size, while convenience sampling gathered 392 respondents. The software for data analysis is SmartPLS 4.1.0.0. The results indicate the acceptance of eight hypotheses and the rejection of the remaining two. Playfulness is positively affecting attitudes and loyalty program usage. Next, affective commitment positively affects attitude and loyalty program usage. Next, reward attractiveness positively affects attitude. Finally, the relationship between attitude, usage, satisfaction, and loyalty is significant. The determinant factors of brand loyalty were playfulness, reward attractiveness, and affective commitment. The theoretical contribution is that the impact of loyalty programs on brand loyalty reveals that factors like playfulness and affective commitment influence attitudes and usage, despite gamification's potential moderating effect. The practical implication is that Gojek should improve its loyalty program strategy by diversifying the range of rewards and integrating gamification, particularly in-app games, to maintain user engagement and brand loyalty. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

An essential measure of a loyalty program’s effectiveness is its members’ point redemption behavior. Customers engage more with the firm when they periodically redeem points. However, current studies find that customers tend to stockpile rather than redeem points. In this research, the authors investigate the relationships between customer relationship characteristics in loyalty programs (i.e., purchase depth, purchase breadth, purchase recency, redemption depth, redemption breadth, and redemption recency) and customers’ point redemption behavior. The empirical analyses show that customers with higher purchase depth and redemption recency are more likely to redeem points. However, customers with higher purchase breadth, purchase recency, redemption depth, and redemption breadth are less likely to redeem points. In addition, once deciding to redeem, customers with higher purchase breadth and purchase recency will redeem more points. The results imply that managers should motivate point redemptions among customers who purchase a lot from the firm but are concentrated on their purchases and redemptions. The findings also indicate that point redemption is a valuable tool to regain customers who are drifting away from the firm. © The Author(s) 2024."

Responses were analysed using a recently developed complementary approach that combines partial least squares structural equation modeling and necessary condition analysis. The findings confirm that perceived benefits are a significant driver and necessary condition for passengers’ willingness to provide personal data. More so, perceived benefits significantly attenuate the negative effect that privacy concerns have on passengers’ willingness to provide personal data. The findings offer theoretical and methodological contributions, as well as implications for policy and practice. © 2023 The Author(s)"

In these programs, promotional incentives are often incorporated to further enhance customer loyalty; however, few previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of such incentives. Therefore, our study examined both short- and long-term effects of promotional incentives in a loyalty program on customer purchase behavior by analyzing a loyalty program using birthday rewards implemented by a major retail company in Japan. For the analysis, we used the Weibull proportional hazards model, generalized linear model, and Pareto/NBD & gamma-gamma framework after implementing propensity score matching. The estimation results indicated that promotional incentives in a loyalty program temporarily weaken the points pressure effect on the purchase frequency. In addition, promotional incentives in a loyalty program had no positive effect of increasing the customer lifetime value. Furthermore, our study revealed that the lifetime values of loyalty program members who do not exhibit their active purchasing behavior for a certain period of time after impulsive actions induced by promotional incentives are particularly low. These findings will help companies to decide how promotional incentives should be incorporated into their loyalty programs. © 2024 The Authors"

One popular reward structure is a catalog of many diverse items. The rewards among this broad selection are likely to differ in their appeal due to their intrinsic differences and customer heterogeneity. Prior research has shown that after redeeming a reward, LP members are more motivated to increase their purchase volume/frequency and share-of-wallet within the program, thereby becoming more active. In this study, we fit a hidden Markov model to a 4½ year longitudinal data set of points accrual and reward redemption activity for about 4500 members of a large coalition LP. Our analysis reveals three latent states — active, hyperactive and inactive. We then investigate the likelihood of LP members transitioning between these states across successive time periods, and examine the reward categories and marketing effort associated with these transitions. Subsequently, we use our model to optimally promote particular reward categories to encourage LP member migration to managerially desirable states or prevent them sliding into a less desirable state. Our proposed optimal reward strategy potentially increases the estimated proportion of LP members in the hyperactive latent state from 35.7% to 40.1%, with a resultant increase in sales revenue for retailers and service providers in the LP of 7.7%. We find that rewards which are more fungible have the strongest influence on increasing points accrual activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

With retailers accounting for a large portion of F&V sales, marketing can be key to increase F&V consumption at household level. However, a key challenge is the design of strategies that benefit retailers, e.g., improving loyalty, whilst promoting societal goals. This study evaluates a points-plus-cash loyalty program where participants received points by purchasing selected F&V, redeemable against a reward (plush toys in the shape of F&V). We estimate the impact of the program by comparing expenditures in several categories before, during, and after the promotional period, across two different years, and comparing consumers who redeemed a reward and those who did not. We use loyalty card data from a Croatian retailer, containing food expenditure in five categories for 268,359 consumers, over 27 weeks for 2 years. We find that the loyalty program increased F&V expenditures at the focal retailer during the promotional period. However, the increase was only for reward-redeemers, for whom the program increased expenditures in F&V as well as in other food categories. This effect persisted – at a declining rate – after the program stopped. Exposure only had a limited effect during the campaign, leading to a reduction in expenditure after the promotional period. Results indicate that a loyalty program promoting sales of F&V can create win-win benefits to both society and the retailer: it increases expenditures on healthy foods (F&V), while improving overall loyalty (i.e., expenditures) to the retailer amongst motivated consumers. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Findings from four studies show that while pride and happiness can similarly increase repurchase intentions following a frequency reward program, only pride (vs. happiness) differentially increases repurchase intentions following a customer tier program. Further, the effects of these emotions are mediated by two distinct paths: the intensity of positive affect (for frequency reward programs) and signaling motives (for customer tier programs).

With a mixed method research design and studies in eight phases, the authors propose a comprehensive measurement instrument that incorporates a schema- and categorization-based theoretical conceptualization of how customers assess omnichannel retail experiences; they also integrate means–end chain theory to explain perceived omnichannel customer experience (OCX) as a construct. This construct captures multiple omnichannel evaluation dimensions: social communications, value, personalization, customer service, consistency of both product availability and prices across channels, information safety, delivery, product returns, and loyalty programs. Multiple applications of the measurement model empirically confirm the suitability of this instrument in consumer goods omnichannel retail settings. Its 36 items reflect nine first-order quality dimensions that combine to form the overall, second-order OCX construct. The measurement instrument offers sound psychometric properties, as confirmed by several reliability and validity tests, and predicts customer behavior reliably across studies. Thus, the OCX measurement instrument offers utility for theory, management practice, and further research. © 2022"

More specifically, TMT suggests that a reminder of one’s own death or mortality salience (MS) is likely to make people defend their cultural worldview and boost their self-esteem by favouring materialism. Indeed, prior research corroborates that individuals consume more in their defence against MS, which also amplifies their materialistic tendencies. However, an empirical exploration on the relationship between TMT and materialism, especially in a Middle Eastern context, seems almost non-existent. To fulfil this research gap, we conducted research in Lebanon with a mixed approach. First, focus groups were conducted. Perhaps due to its critical geopolitical location and history in the region, our findings suggest that there is a preference for experiential rather than materialistic consumption under MS in the short term. Research on experiential consumption shows that people prefer experiences to material purchases in the distant future, and that the social context of the experience shapes its attractiveness. Second, we carried out an experiment, positing that MS may induce more experiential consumption, rather than materialistic consumption, particularly in the near future, in a brand loyalty setting.

Despite the popularity of these programmes, which are used by 73% of economically active South Africans, no tax is currently imposed on the rewards received by customers, resulting in the loss of much-needed tax revenue. This paper quantifies the tax revenue that could have been generated by South Africa’s three most-used CLPs over a five-year period (2018–2022) to determine if a tax on CLP rewards is a viable revenue stream for the fiscus. The longitudinal instrumental case study employed demonstrates that the fiscus could have conservatively collected R1 140 753 042 in total tax revenue from the three CLPs if a tax had been imposed on CLP rewards, as proposed in this paper. This paper highlights the significant revenue potential of taxing CLP rewards, and it provides valuable insights for policymakers who seek to address the country’s revenue challenges. The findings reveal the magnitude of potential contributions to tax revenue in the form of CLPs. Given the impetus behind CLPs, their exponential growth rate and their increasing importance as a marketing strategy, this paper proposes a re-evaluation by policymakers of the taxation of CLP rewards. © 2024 South African Journal of Accounting Research."

Such variable rates are particularly common in loyalty programs in the hospitality industry. In this research, the authors show that the stability of the exchange rate—whether the exchange rate is fixed or variable across offers—systematically influences point redemption. Consumers are less likely to redeem loyalty points and instead spend money when they observe a variable exchange rate between money and points than when they observe a fixed exchange rate, even when the average value of points is the same. This effect is demonstrated in a series of studies across contexts, including an incentive-compatible retail loyalty program and a hotel loyalty program. The findings show that a variable point exchange rate induces more optimism than a fixed exchange rate, reducing point redemption. This effect is moderated by individual differences in optimism and by point expiration date. The authors conclude by discussing the implications for managers of loyalty programs and for consumers.

We extend loyalty program theories by proposing five mechanisms that capture the competitive effects in multi-firm, multi-level loyalty programs. We empirically test our hypotheses using data from a loyalty program management app where customers manage points independently across competing firms. We utilize goal shielding theory to show how a customer’s purchase at the focal firm is affected by the customer’s purchases and redemptions across competing firms. Specifically, we find that a customer’s purchase probability at the focal firm decreases after they qualify for a reward independent of redemption at a competing firm (competitive mere reward qualification) and after they redeem a reward at a competing firm (competitive rewarded behavior). Further, we find that the customer’s purchase probability at the focal firm increases if the customer is far from both the qualified and higher-level rewards at the competing firm (competitive stuck-in-the-middle), and if the customer accelerated their purchase frequency to qualify for or redeem a reward at the competing firm (competitive effort balancing post qualification and redemption).

Using data from a leading U.S. airline, we empirically test the theoretical prediction that travelers’ switching costs vary dynami-cally with their progress toward attaining status. We show evidence for increased switching costs as the consumer approaches the target pace of point accumulation required to attain status. These switching costs reflect changes in booking behavior with the airline: Travelers become more likely to choose the airline even when it is less appealing than its competitors, and to pay higher prices than they otherwise would. These responses are reduced when travelers accumulate points at a rate substantially ahead of the target pace. The increase in switching costs is more pronounced for consumers at a hub of the airline and for business travelers. Moreover, we document a stronger willingness-to-pay response when consumers are less likely to shoulder the ticket costs themselves because they are traveling for business. This response suggests that asymmetric incentives induced by business travel explain much of the heterogeneity between business and leisure travel-ers, and moral hazard may be responsible for a large part of the profitability of frequent-flyer status incentives. © 2022, INFORMS."

This occurs because while low-PDB consumers are only sensitive to the monetary losses associated with the demotion, high-PDB consumers are sensitive to both the monetary and psychological losses. More importantly, we find that when consumers receive the appropriate monetary (for low-PDB) or status-symbolic (for high-PDB) compensation, the negative effect of demotion is attenuated. Additionally, we find that proactive approaches are more effective in mitigating negative responses to demotion; accordingly, marketers should warn consumers of a prospective demotion and offer consumers help in maintaining their existing membership tier. Doing so results in a win-win situation where consumers avoid demotion and marketers achieve higher profits.

Mobile-driven loyalty apps substantially lower consumer search costs, thereby enhancing on-demand information accessibility and facilitating the monitoring of reward points. Based on a unique data set that comprises information on customers' loyalty app adoption status, loyalty point redemption patterns, and purchase behaviors in MVLP environments, we investigate how the transition from plastic-based programs to loyalty apps influences the out-of-pocket spending and point redemption patterns of consumers. Our findings reveal that the adoption of loyalty apps is associated with an increase in purchases and the predilection for point redemption. Despite these positive outcomes, however, potential adverse consequences may arise in the form of deal-susceptible behaviors and reduced store-specific loyalty. Loyalty app adopters tend to be more vulnerable to deals, with these customers selectively buying highly discounted products of low margin. Additionally, loyalty app consumers visit more stores but spend less in a focal store, thereby diminishing loyalty to this specific store.

Leveraging data from 322 publicly-traded firms that introduced an LP between 2000 and 2015, the authors demonstrate that introducing an LP can increase sales and gross profits in the short term (within the first year), and these positive effects are sustained long term (for at least three years). However, the effects on gross profits do not become significant until the second quarter after LP introduction, and their overall impact on performance lags substantially behind sales. Complementing these primary findings, the results reveal that offering an LP with tiers or earning mechanisms can provide firms with significant increases in sales and gross profits.

Can uncertainty drive repetition? Four experiments, all involving real consequences for each individual participant, document a counterintuitive reinforcing-uncertainty effect: individuals repeat a behavior more if its incentive is uncertain than if it is certain, even when the certain incentive is financially better. This effect is robust; it holds in both lab and field settings and at both small and large magnitudes. Furthermore, the experiments identify two theory-driven boundary conditions for the reinforcing-uncertainty effect: the effect arises (a) only if the uncertainty is resolved immediately and not if the resolution of uncertainty is delayed, and (b) only after, not before, one has engaged in repetitions. These results support a resolution-as-reward account and cast doubt on other explanations such as reference-dependent preferences.

Sales promotion applications commonly used by health services organizations include free samples, free trials, coupons, contests, and loyalty programs. These avenues engender goodwill, appreciation, and attentiveness; they also serve as small, but powerful promotional mechanisms by reminding recipients of healthcare institutions, compelling particular actions, encouraging repeat business, or prompting some related desirable in an effort to hasten exchange and bolster loyalty. Discussion: Sales promotion offers myriad opportunities for healthcare providers to connect with audiences. While limited in their power to attract broad audiences when used in isolation, sales promotion avenues used in tandem with other marketing communications create helpful engagement synergies which amplify conveyance initiatives. This article presents an overview of sales promotion and notably shares deployment insights and experiences from Willis-Knighton Health System, permitting peer healthcare establishments to view associated pathways, reflect on their own sales promotion efforts, and potentially bolster initiatives with the perspectives supplied herein. Conclusions: Sales promotion offers healthcare providers a complementary communications avenue, helping to reinforce other elements of the marketing communications mix, affording opportunities to develop better connections with patients. In formulating associated communication plans, health and medical establishments should be reminded of the benefits offered by sales promotion and especially strive to effect creative applications that build interest and attention.

To this end, we undertake a UK wide analysis of loyalty card data assembled by a major UK grocery retailer and provide guidelines for their effective deployment in the domains of urban and retail analysis. We assess, for the first time, the ‘completeness’ of circa 500 million customer transactions recorded by a major customer loyalty programme in representing the overall purchasing patterns of circa 16 million consumers across the entire UK, and develop a method by which to do this.

As an essential element of loyalty programs (LPs), the reward amount invested by the retailer is often linked to retailer's profit and customer behavior. We consider a retailer who sells a type of product in two periods to strategic customers. The retailer makes inventory ordering and loyalty program investment decisions. Customers decide whether to purchase immediately (in period 1) to receive the product and reward, or to wait for a markdown discount but face the risk of stockout. We have focused on three main questions: (1) How does the loyalty reward investment decision impact strategic customers’ behavior? (2) What are the optimal decisions and profits for the retailer when investing in a loyalty program? (3) What are the factors influencing the reward investment decision? We find that investing in the loyalty program induces more customers to make an early purchase, leading to a higher inventory ordering decision and more profit for the retailer. The benefits from reward investments are significantly affected by the product's cost and customers’ valuation of the product. Our results shed light on the reward investment decision of LPs. For products with high profit margins and market-determined prices (valuation approximates price), the retailer should invest in a loyalty program to achieve better profits. © 2021"

We model a duopoly market in which one firm adopts a loyalty program. Firms independently and simultaneously set the prices and rewards. Heterogeneous customers buy homogeneous products in a multi-period setting. Customers are segmented into three groups based on their level of strategic behavior, which is expressed in terms of their degree of forward-lookingness. We use two exogenous parameters to represent the size of each segment. A third parameter captures the point pressure effect, which refers to the increase in customer spending as they approach a reward threshold. In each period, customers choose the firm that maximizes their utility, which is a function of offered prices, rewards, and the distance to the next reward. We use the logit model to model the customer choice behavior. Customers’ accumulated purchases evolve as a Markov chain. We derive the limiting distribution of accumulated purchases, which is subsequently used to formulate the firm’s expected revenue functions. We develop two algorithms to find the Nash equilibrium for both the linear and nonlinear rewards in term of the three parameters. Using a thorough numerical analysis, we show that the choice of the structure becomes more critical as the size of the strategic segment increases. The nonlinear scheme is superior when the size of the highly-strategic segment is very small. The linear rewards is superior in markets where the size of the highly-strategic segment and the sensitivity to distance are simultaneously not small. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

These programs often run alongside the retailers’ permanent loyalty programs in an attempt to increase customer engagement. Despite the growing popularity of TLPs, the literature on the topic remains limited. We address this gap by looking at the redemption rate, the industry's primary success indicator, of almost 900 TLPs across a broad set of grocery retailers in 45 countries. We study the effects of four key design characteristics (the duration of the program, the discount offered, the spending requirement before an award can be redeemed, and the reward depth) on the redemption rate, and explore how these effects vary across a broad range of retailer and country characteristics. In doing so, we control for both a retailer's potential self-selection into running a TLP and the potential endogeneity of the subsequent design choices. We derive a set of actionable results on how to design successful TLPs and show that high redemption rates are not only beneficial for the program operator and reward manufacturer, but also translate into higher sales and profit for the retailer. © 2022 The Authors"

Advancing a theoretical framework of social media engagement, the authors test the association between various forms of DCE and customer behavior using archived field data. By matching store visit data from 1,066 loyalty program members of a leading national fast casual restaurant with their engagements on the brand's Facebook page, the authors are able to compare the strength of the relationships between various forms of engagement and store visit frequency.

The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are sensitive to price. They also find that participants’ preferences and levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision making. The model classifies participants into five segments that exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies.

This technology also enables them to compare how well they are doing relative to others in a variety of contexts, ranging from online gaming to losing weight to loyalty programs. This research investigates consumers' motivation to achieve a goal when they compare themselves with a superior other who has already attained the goal. Building on the literature on social comparison, and on competition in particular, we find that consumers are less motivated when the superior other has attained the goal compared to when the superior other is just ahead, keeping the relative distance equal. This negative effect on motivation is evident even in situations in which consumers can still attain the same goal as the superior other. We argue and demonstrate that this effect occurs because the other's goal attainment limits consumers' prospect to compete and overtake the superior other. Six experimental studies show evidence for this effect in hypothetical loyalty programs and behavioral task completion. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the motivational effect of social comparison, which have implications for marketing managers and public policy makers. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Furthermore, although introducing a loyalty program generates immediate spikes in sales and profits in most categories; its impact is generally short-lived. It results in an initial redistribution of category expenditures during the program launch, where consumers seemingly shift consumption from lightly purchased categories to heavily purchased categories.

In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA.

We use a model of multi-store purchase incidence and spend to show how the value of points shared among partner stores can explain patterns in customer-level purchases across them. We also allow reward spillovers to be moderated by three measures of store affinity that characterize a coalition's portfolio: the relative popularity, geographic distance, and overlap in product categories between each pair of stores. For the coalition studied, popularity affinity was the main determinant of the valence of cross-reward effects, both before and after the devaluation. In contrast, category and geographic affinity had a smaller and more heterogenous impact. Through the use of an event where the loyalty program uniformly devalued the entire coalition's value of reward points, we show that cross-reward effects changed (lessened), leading to larger financial losses for the most popular stores. While we do not observe changes to the composition of the coalition's portfolio, our results also suggest that the value of a shared reward currency may be driven by the inclusion of smaller partners. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Nudges were presented in the form of messages sent through WhatsApp to customers three times a week for 8 weeks (between July and September 2020). Messages highlighted the benefits of cooking at home and eating mindfully and healthy (vegetables, fruits, healthy snacks, legumes, and fish), and included easy to implement tips. Results show that, on average, customers assigned to the treatment group increased their purchases of healthy food by 8% and substituted sugar-sweetened for sugar-free beverages. We find an unintended increase in purchases of unhealthy food of 7%, with no correlative increase in calories, suggesting that customers substituted higher calorie products for lower calorie ones. We find that households with lower educational attainment, lower income, and with children under the age of 12 are more likely to increase purchases of fruits and vegetables, while other households are more likely to improve the diet quality without increasing expenditure. Effects do not persist after the intervention is over, suggesting that salience, rather than information is the main channel triggering the effects. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Although studies have analyzed the individual impacts of LP rewards and targeted coupons on shopping trip incidence and expenditures, they have not compared the two instruments. By investigating the LP of a leading German grocery retailer that uses both LP rewards (points to redeem for free products) and individually targeted coupons, the current study establishes a comparison of their profitability and relative contributions to increasing shopping trips and expenditures. The investigated LP also relies on in-store kiosks to interact with customers, so they can decide when to redeem LP points and request coupons. By jointly modeling the effects of LP point redemptions and coupons on shopping trip incidence and expenditures, using their decision to access the kiosk as a dependent variable and rich data that span thousands of customers over 60 weeks, this study reveals that both instruments increase shopping trip incidence, kiosk access, and expenditures. The LP point redemptions have a stronger effect on shopping trip incidence; coupons have a stronger effect on kiosk access. Although a single redemption of LP points leads to a greater increase in expenditures than a single coupon redemption (€1.46 vs. €0.48), coupons yield three times greater expenditures after controlling for usage frequency; lower discounts also contribute to coupons’ higher profitability. Therefore, LP point redemptions and individually targeted coupons are complementary tools for retailers.

Building on the microfoundations of strategic, forward-looking, and status-seeking consumer behavior, we endogenize strategic consumer response to firms’ pricing and loyalty program design decisions, and we characterize conditions under which, by coordinating these decisions, firms can benefit from strategic consumer behavior. We further show that by switching to a spending-based design, firms can benefit from strategic behavior even more, under broader conditions, and in a Pareto-improving way.

In examining these relationships, we also take customer’s individual characteristics into consideration. The level of self-interest and need to vent are examined as moderating variables in the relationships between the point management strategy and firm avoidance and between the point management strategy and patronage reduction, through perceived unfairness.

Applications from the private sector have found resonance in a public setting, however, simply extrapolating research results is not acceptable, as their rationale inherently differs. This study focuses on data from a loyalty program issued by the city of Antwerp (Belgium). The aim of the loyalty card entails large citizen participation, however, an active user base of only 20 % is reached. Predictive techniques are employed to increase this number. Using spatial behavioral user information, a Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine are used which result in models capable of predicting whether a user will actively use its card, whether a user will defect in the near future and which locations a user will visit. Also, a projection of spatial behavioral data onto even more fine-grained spatio-temporal data is performed. The results are promising: the best model achieves an AUC value of 92.5 %, 85.5 % and 88.12 % (averaged over five locations) for the predictions, respectively. Moreover, as behavior is modeled in more detail, better predictions are made. Two main contributions are made in this study. First, as a theoretical contribution, fine-grained behavioral data contributes to a more sound decision-making process. Second, as a practical contribution, the city of Antwerp can now make tailored strategic decisions to increase its active user base. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, little is known about the interplay between members' purchase and redemption behavior when members are not pressured with point expiration and they choose for themselves when and how much to redeem. In this context, the effects of redemption are not straightforward, as little additional effort is required from an LP member to obtain the reward. Analyzing the behavior of 3094 members in such an LP, we find that the mere decision to redeem a reward significantly enhances purchase behavior before and after the redemption event, even when members redeem just a fraction of their accumulated points. Conceptually, we refer to this enhancement as the redemption momentum, which is an alternative and novel explanation of the existence of pre-reward effects that do not depend on points-pressure. In addition to the overall impact of redemption on purchases, prior purchase behavior also enhances redemption decisions. Finally, we find a number of moderating effects on purchase and redemption behavior that derive from the length of LP membership, age, income and direct mailings. Our study's most important managerial implication is that firms should avoid imposing point expiry and/or binding thresholds in order to enhance members' purchase behavior. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

Active program participation, however, is an important condition that has to be fulfilled in order for firms to benefit from intended consequences of loyalty programs such as a greater ability to target special consumer segments basing on insights derived from consumer transaction data (Berman 2006). Since card usage frequency is a central indicator for loyalty program success, the present paper contributes to existing research by investigating both, individual level and program level determinants of loyalty card usage frequency. From a managerial perspective, it is highly relevant to determine if differences in firm actions are reflected in differences in loyalty card usage frequency across loyalty programs. Our conceptual model consists of two levels. At the individual level, we build on the customer equity concept as conceptualized by Rust, Lemon, and Zeithaml (2001, 2004). In essence, we propose that three different aspects influence usage intensity: (1) value equity, (2) relationship equity, and (3) brand equity. At the program level, we conceptualize that program-related variables and industry characteristics contribute to the effectiveness of loyalty programs. Thereby, we mainly anchor our study in Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991) and in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1986). Theory of Planned Behavior is used to justify value and economic based determinants and hindrances to use the loyalty card as well as consumers’ experiences related to loyalty programs, while Social Identity Theory provides a theoretical basis for socio-relational and psychological determinants of loyalty card usage frequency. In order to test the conceptual model empirically, the customer level data (n = 779) is “nested” in the loyalty program level data (n = 33). Thereby, we seek to obtain individual drivers of loyalty card usage frequency as well as program-related factors and involvement within certain industries to explain between-group differences. Given the hierarchical structure of the data, hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) is an adequate method for analysis and hence applied in this study. Our findings reveal, that on the individual level consumer program-related customer satisfaction, social benefits and brand attitude are associated with loyalty card usage frequency. Having said this, loyalty program providers should try to build personal relationships with the customer, satisfy customers’ needs to express their membership (e.g., the self-identity) to out-group members, and try to bind customers emotionally. Regarding the value equity drivers of loyalty card usage frequency, reducing the perceived efforts of using the loyalty card constitutes an important determinant whereas the perceived attractiveness of the rewards provides no significant effect. With regard to consumers’ experiences with loyalty programs, we suggest firms to focus their communication budgets on motivating newly acquired customers to use the program regularly as well as on inexperienced card users who are not already familiar with using loyalty cards. On the program level, a status function and the associated relational benefits enhance social identity with the loyalty program (Dutton, Dukerich, and Harquail 1994), and strengthen the relationship between customers and loyalty program, whereas a rebate or bonus function show no significant impact on loyalty card usage frequency. Besides, we suggest that a payment function contributes negatively to loyalty card usage frequency due to an increase in complexity, a lack of perceived usefulness or perceived difficulty of use (Taylor and Todd 1995). Moreover, we could not find evidence that members of fee-based loyalty programs are more motivated in actually using the loyalty card as a result of their idiosyncratic investments than members of non-fee-based loyalty programs. However, entry fees are found to strengthen the link between satisfaction and usage intensity of the loyalty program. Nevertheless, if customers have to pay an entry fee, customer’s brand attitude affects loyalty card usage frequency even negatively. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the higher the level of involvement within a certain industry, the lower the loyalty card usage frequency. Hence, in high involvement conditions, the product/service is more important than the rewards and benefits associated with the loyalty program (Dowling and Uncles 1997; Rothschild and Gaidis 1981). The fact that brand attitude is less important to explain loyalty card usage in high involvement industries provides additional support for this argument. Hence, under high involvement conditions, loyalty programs should be linked closer to the product/service in order to enhance the value proposition of the product/service. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

A 2 (low/high controlling) × 2 (accumulation/instant program) × (social/economic rewards) design tests hypotheses informed by cognitive evaluation and rational choice theories. Results show firms employing accumulation programs with highly controlling policies should highlight their social rewards (e.g., a hotel with blackout dates on redeeming rewards would want to highlight their special lounges or dining areas); whereas, low controlling policies work best when offering financial rewards (e.g., free upgrades or percentages off). In instant programs, the type of reward generally does not influence consumers' commitment levels. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

Healthcare, like hospitality, is an experience and credence service. Services with predominantly credence attributes are typically the case for highly specialized services or services that only occur once a twice in a lifetime, such as medical diagnoses and hospitalization. Credence services are the most difficult to verify because they often lack physical evidence of the service process. To evaluate the credence qualities of the service, inferences will be made based on experience-based portion of the total service delivery process. One of the emerging trends in the industry is to introduce the concept of hospitality into hospitals. For example, Severt et al. (2008) explore an organization-wide philosophy of hospitality (i.e., hospitality centric philosophy) in a hospital setting. It is not new for the healthcare industry to learn from other industries including the hotel and entertainment industries (Cheung-Larivee 2011a; Kaissi 2012; Lee 2004). Disney has also been marketing its services to hospitals even before the government demands an online patient satisfaction surveys. Florida Hospital’s children’s unit improved its patient satisfaction scores from the bottom 10 % of the country to the top 10 % 1 year after it hired Disney. The purpose of this study is to explore various ways to incorporate hospitality management practices and customer service into hospitals and opportunities that these proposed changes may bring to the healthcare industry in the U.S. This study focuses on, (1) market expansion, (2) integrated medical services, (3) quality measurement and creation of improved patient experience. Proposition 1: A hospitality enhanced healthcare facility will not only be able to serve the needs of local residents but also patients who live in other states or countries. Proposition 2: A hospitality service enhanced healthcare facility is composed of three major functions: core medical service (the core medical product that patients value the most when they make decisions regarding their well-being), support service (informational and environmental services), and hospitality service (service that focuses on enhancing the total experience for patients, which is a proposed new addition to the traditional healthcare service structure). This model proposes a transformation from customer relationship management (CRM) to patient relationship management (PRM). Proposition 3: A hospitality enhanced medical facility will enable patients to enjoy an improved experience at the facility. Besides clinical outcomes, patient experience is valued as a critical component to measurement of quality outcome. Patients’ satisfaction is believed to improve recovery rate, speed up healing process, provide healing power of mind, and increase patient compliance. In conclusion, our model illustrates how hospitals may expand their target market, generate more revenue, improve service quality, and build a strong loyalty program by creating hospitality enhanced healthcare facilities and implementing key customer service concept in the entertainment industry. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science."

Two field studies demonstrate the mechanisms driving this effect. First, fit effects result from the interaction between reward type and presentation format (i.e., verbal vs. numerical) and affect perceived reward values and investment decisions. Second, cognitive engagement and ""feeling right"" about reward redemption mediate the effects of fit on investment opportunity evaluations. In turn, the findings demonstrate that CRP efficacy can be enhanced by stimulating regulatory orientations that match the presentation formats of the reward and that the dual affective-cognitive processes affect probabilistic judgments of rewards. This additional mechanism can further stimulate resellers' engagement with and investment in CRPs within complex decision-making contexts. © 2013."

They do fairly well in acquiring new members of LPs, but firms often fail to engage them in the long term. This article seeks to understand what engagement in LPs is, how to measure it, and how it relates to company engagement. With four studies, the authors conceptualize LP engagement as six behavioral manifestations: proactively using cards, redeeming points, adapting purchase behavior, being receptive to information, sharing information, and searching for information. The 20-item scale proposed to measure these behaviors provides a viable, novel tool for determining customers' LP engagement. Whereas previous research on LPs mainly considers card usage or point redemption behaviors as proxies for customers' LP engagement, the current research shows that these behaviors are insufficient indicators of the actual level of engagement in LPs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

Hotels use these practices in order to increase their incomes.

This study explores four YM practices that might be suitable in the hotel context through an empirical study of the behavior of 1010 customers. The study consists of non-parametric tests to analyze the perception of YM practices and Anova tests to identify relationships between the variables that may explain customer behavior. The results show that the manner of presenting the YM practices to consumers (positive or negative frame) has a considerable influence on their perception. Lastly, loyal customers perceive price changes the YM introduces as more unfavorable. From this point of view, firms can use several managerial levers in the communication of tariff practices and management of loyalty programs to avoid or reduce customers’ perception of unfairness. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

We collaborated with a major hotel chain to launch a large scale field experiment involving 95,532 existing loyalty customers. We observed customers’ hotel stays for eight months before the experiment, eight months during the experiment, and eight months after the experiment. Customers in the treatment group were asked to increase their hotel nights during the 8-month promotion by a set percentage relative to their baseline to receive a reward. Overall, the promotion led to increased purchasing in the post-promotion period. However, only 20% of customers successfully reached the goal whereas 80% missed the goal. We use a propensity score analysis to examine the distinct effects of goal achievement versus goal failure. Results show that goal attainment significantly increased post-promotion purchasing whereas goal failure significantly reduced post-promotion purchasing. Additionally, we use econometric methods to empirically test a behavioral theory of relationship-based reciprocity. We find that customers in a high status tier relationship, with the most invested in the firm, are most affected by goal failure whereas customers in a low status tier relationship, with the least invested in the firm, are most affected by goal success. Because the type of loyalty program described in this paper is widely used in a variety of industries the findings suggest that marketers should set reachable goals within loyalty promotion programs.

Prior research offers evidence that buyers might increase the frequency of purchases and volume per occasion in a loyalty program; however, the effect on buyers’ price tolerance has not been studied before. The aim of this paper is to examine buyers’ willingness to pay a price premium for a firm offering a loyalty program reward. Design/methodology/approach – An analytical model of dynamic consumer choice is developed, where one of the two selling firms offers a reward for a certain number of purchases. The maximum price premium that a normatively rational buyer should be willing to pay at each level of accumulated purchases is obtained. A price tolerance in controlled settings is obtained and these are compared with normative solutions. Findings – Analytically, it is shown that the maximum price premium increases as purchases are accumulated; and the exact solutions can be found, given the price distributions and program design parameters. In the empirical studies it is found that individuals’ maximum premiums are less than the normative levels. On the other hand, as buyers accumulate purchases from the reward offering firm, and get closer to the reward, maximum premiums paid increase – particularly when the reward is immediate. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the loyalty programs literature by examining the price premium, or switching barrier, aspect of buyer response.

A number of variables are recorded in the survey that are not available from other data collection methods. The drivers of SOW are determined using a 2-limit Tobit model which incorporates the direct and interactive aspects of the pathways identified in the Conceptual Framework. At one of the stores (Woolworths), the influence of loyalty schemes is found to vary with customers’ perceptions of stores, with implications for enhanced customer targeting by food retail managers. The impact of loyalty programs is found to be mitigated by the entry of a competitor, particularly in the case of price-conscious customers.

Some researchers found positive effects (Keh and Lee 2006), while others have not found any effects of LPs (Sharp and Sharp 1997). Shugan (2005) considers them as shams because they produce liabilities (e.g. promises of future rewards or deferred rebates) rather than assets. They can foster customers’ short-term loyalty to the programme instead of developing long-term company loyalty. The objective of this research is to better understand how LPs can produce assets by creating long-term relationships instead of making customers only loyal to the programme and provide liabilities to the company. Based on a dataset matching behavioural and attitudinal data, this research proposes that some behavioural patterns, based on LP members’ speed of earning loyalty points and redemption rate, will have an impact on the gap between programme loyalty and company loyalty. While a high speed of earning (combined with low redemption) or a high redemption rate (combined with a low speed of earning) will reduce this gap, a high speed of earning combined with a high redemption rate will increase this gap. Our study contributes to both marketing research and practice in two different ways. First, we investigate the gap between LP loyalty and company loyalty by considering them together as an outcome variable. Previous research has mainly investigated both loyalties separately by investigating what their antecedents are and how LP loyalty affects company loyalty. Second, despite the fact that attitudes and behaviours are closely linked (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975), few research have studied the effects of behaviours on attitudes in an LP context. The present research tries to fill in this gap by exploring the relationship between the LP, customers’ attitudes and behaviours.

Despite frms across the globe spend billions of dollars on LPs, it is not clear: whether these programs enhance customer loyalty, what happens if a program is terminated and which LP design elements enhance effectiveness of LPs. Design/methodology/approach – The authors empirically investigate to what extent the effects of introducing and terminating a LP depend on: its monetary and non-monetary design elements, customer characteristics and competition. The empirical evidence is based on a bivariate hierarchical linear model, using a large-scale dataset involving 9,783 consumers rating 24 different LPs across eight industries. Findings – While the characteristics of LP are more important in infuencing customer behavior when they join the LP, the competitive environment and the duration of membership in an LP are the primary drivers of customer reactions to LP termination. Non-monetary discrimination between members and non-members is a more powerful tool in creating customer loyalty than offering higher discounts or saving points. The effect of discrimination on loyalty sustains when an LP is terminated. Research limitations/implications – This is the frst research to empirically investigate the effect of an LP termination, accounting for simultaneous effects of LP designs and competition effects. The authors measured behavioral intentions in a hypothetical case of LP termination. Future research could assess the effects of LP termination and the moderating role of both monetary and non-monetary design elements on other behavioral loyalty variables based on, e.g. household panel data, when such data on LP terminations across industries becomes available. Practical implications – When a frm considers the introduction of an LP or changing an existing one, non-monetary discrimination between members and non-members seems to be the most effective tool in building sustainable customer loyalty. Further, offering a relatively low saving rate is a viable way to keep costs down because the savings percentage does not signifcantly affect loyalty. For the same reason, frms can also consider reducing or eliminating LP-based discounts. The competitive environment and the duration of membership in an LP are the primary drivers of customer reactions to LP termination. Originality/value – To the best of authors’ knowledge, the potential effects of LP termination have not been addressedin the current literature. The authors empirically assess the effects of LP termination and effects of those programs at the introduction. Understanding the factors that moderate the potential negative impact of terminating an LP is of crucial importance to managers and researchers alike. The paper is of great value for frms that consider introducing, modifying or terminating an LP. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This article presents three studies—two experiments and one survey—in support of the notion that a greater understanding of loyalty program performance demands an expanded theoretical framework. Specifically, researchers and managers must account for loyalty programs’ effects on both target and bystander customers in the firm’s portfolio, the simultaneous effects of three performance-relevant mediating mechanisms (gratitude, status, unfairness), and the contingent effects of program delivery (rule clarity, reward exclusivity, reward visibility) on specific mediating linkages. The results provide insights into why and when loyalty programs fail and into the complex trade-offs managers face. Loyalty programs have opposing effects on target and bystander customers’ loyalty and sales. While rule clarity suppresses both negative bystander as well as positive target effects, reward visibility enhances both types of effects. Exclusive rewards offer a means to alleviate negative bystander effects without affecting targets.

Smartcards (multifunctional cards), which bundle payment with non-payment functions (e.g., loyalty programs, identification, and other information functions), have become an increasingly popular payment mode. This shift toward multifunctionality in payment modes is assumed to reduce payment transparency and consequently to decrease consumers’ recall accuracy of past expenditures. We employ a field study to examine recall accuracy for recent purchases with cash, a single-function card, and a multifunctional card. We find that recall accuracy is lower when using a single- or a multifunction card than cash. We also find that it is not the multifunctionality of the card that results in a higher recall error but the individual usage patterns: A higher usage frequency of the non-payment functions results in a higher recall error. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

We analyze the short- and long-term effectiveness of different types of interactive online advertising channels with special attention to the differences between existing and new customers. We look at the sales effect of search engine marketing (SEM), banner advertising, price comparison advertising (PCA) and customer loyalty program advertising (CLA) using a sample of 2.8 million purchases and over 1.1 million individual costumers. The data spans a period of 365 days and was obtained from the.com-website of a leading online-platform for used and antiquarian books. Since SEM, banner advertising, and CLA are widely know we will focus our brief introduction on PCA: Price comparison websites are internet service platforms that allow users to compare prices across a wide variety of retailers. Next to each displayed price there is a link to the retailers’ website, and clicks on these links can be counted to determine effectiveness. Since retailers pay to be listed on these price comparison websites and can improve their ranking position by paying a premium, price comparison websites are much more an advertising channel than an objective tool to screen the market. Therefore, we call placement on such sites price comparison advertising (PCA). Like search engine advertising PCA is a type of interactive on-demand advertising (Rappaport 2007). The model used to estimate carryover effects of advertising is based on the direct aggregation approach derived from Srinivasan and Weir (1988) and works as described in Herrington and Dempsey (2005). It delivers a separate λ-values for the carryover effect of each advertising channel and is estimated with Stata 11 using Generalized Least Squares. The findings indicate that different online advertising channels have different carryover effects (e.g. λPCA,EC: 0.05 vs. λSEM,NC: 0.65), which means that their sales impact ranges between less than a day (e.g. PCAEC: 0.8 days) and a couple of days (e.g. SEMNC: 5.3 days). Only by using the direct aggregation approach with separate λ-values for each advertising channel that we employed here, instead of a one-size-fits-all λ for all channels together, it is possible to identify the appropriate carryover effect for each advertising channel. Our calculations show that in the analyzed sample, all else being equal, banners and CLA are working better to target existing customers whereas PCA is better suited to attract new customers. Although those results might vary by e.g., product category or ad content, our contribution is the approach of how to consider time-lags and long-term advertising effects when analyzing the target group specific effectiveness of different online advertising channels. On top of this general marketing research can profit from our results because the approach can also be used for offline and mixed offline/online environments to improve marketing mix decision. The results indicate that existing studies that ignore long-term effects of advertising, use a one-size-fits-all λ for all channels, or do not differentiate between target groups could be improved by considering those elements which significantly influence advertising success. Several avenues for further research exist. To keep it short we present only one of the avenues: It would be interesting to understand the influence of physical differences between online and offline advertising on its effectiveness. In particular we ask: Do physical circumstances of online, in comparison to offline advertising (e.g. customer has to leave its house after watching a TV ad, before he/she can buy the advertised product) influence psychological effects of advertising (e.g. intermediate ad effects)? © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

In particular, a loyalty program, which provides rewards that can be used for future purchase, is a widely adopted promotion strategy by both offline and online retailers with the intention of increasing customer retention and resultant profits. However, the profit contribution of loyalty programs in offline markets is highly controversial. Our question is whether the result will be similar in online markets. Our game-theoretic model shows that the likelihood of success for loyalty programs is higher in online than in offline markets. We note that consumers' preference for retail stores is more dynamic, and the cost of revisiting a store to redeem loyalty rewards is relatively lower in online markets, because consumers in online markets do not incur physical transportation costs. These characteristics provide the condition where loyalty programs effectively facilitate customer retention, while having fewer risks of rewarding the customers who would have made a purchase regardless of any offered rewards. Our model also suggests that, due to the more dynamic consumer preference in online markets, transaction data collected through loyalty programs provides stronger profit incentives for retailers. Our study helps retailers understand the differences between offline and online markets as well as the impact of the differences on the effectiveness of their loyalty programs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the credit card industry, the creation and execution of effective rewards programs has been the primary way credit cards differentiate their offerings. This paper examines how hard and soft benefits of credit card loyalty programs are perceived, and how they influence attitudinal and behavioral loyalty. In line with the SDL perspective, the importance of soft benefits is emphasized. The results show that attitudinal loyalty is a key mediator of the relationships between both hard and soft benefits of loyalty programs and behavioral loyalty.

We subsequently undertake a survey of members from the Fly Buys LP to see how much they care about points prices exceeding market prices.

Despite the widespread use of such programs, academics have long debated whether these benefits are outweighed by the potential negative impact of the differential treatment of customers. This study aims to extend our understanding, examining the impact of message framing on consumers’ reactions to hierarchical loyalty structures. Design/methodology/approach: Three online studies were conducted. Study 1 uses advertisements to manipulate the message frame’s emphasis (benefits vs status). Study 2 manipulates consumers’ frame of thought by directing their attention to either changes in benefits or status. Finally, Study 3 uses the proposed framework to reconcile contradictory findings from past research. Findings: Low-frequency customers who do not expect to qualify for a superior customer tier tend to reject hierarchical programs when thinking about status. In contrast, when these customers think about concrete rewards, loyalty program messages produce no negative reactions. High-frequency customers are positively affected by communication regardless of the type of benefits framed. Research limitations/implications: All studies were done online, potentially limiting the external validity of the results. Nevertheless, the impact of message framing on perceptions about the loyalty program seems to be quite robust across different studies and manipulations. Practical implications: When communicating with low-frequency customers, managers should avoid promising status; customers should instead be motivated based on concrete rewards. High-frequency customers are indifferent to alternative emphasis of communication frames. Originality/value: Marketing academics have acknowledged the importance of being able to reward top customers without demotivating light and moderate users.

These motivations are economic (the value of forgone points), cognitive (nonmonetary transaction costs), and psychological (customers value points differently than cash). The authors capture the psychological motivation by allowing customers to book cash and point transactions in separate mental accounts. They estimate the model on data from an international retailer using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and accurately forecast redemptions during an 11-month out-of-sample period.

In three experiments we found that both state and chronic differences in experienced construal level modulate the impact of progress framing on motivation at a specific stage in goal pursuit, i.e., when consumers are halfway between the initial and end state, but is less consequential at the initial or end stages. This modulation shows that type of framing only affected motivation of people with an abstract, but not a concrete mindset. Under these conditions, progress framed in terms of to-date produced increased motivation compared to a to-go frame.

The study examines the effects of heterogeneity and assortativity of customer revenue on the profit impact of negative word-of-mouth that is initiated by three groups of consumers—revenue leaders, social hubs, and experts. The authors explore these effects using an agent-based simulation modeling approach and an in-depth computational experiment with empirical input data regarding social connectivity from 10 consumer social networks. The results indicate that negative word-of-mouth is more damaging in markets where there is a higher degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, assortativity may significantly affect the profit impact of disappointments, but this effect depends on the initial percentage of disappointed adopters. The study also finds an interaction between heterogeneity and assortativity, such that the effect of heterogeneity increases as assortativity increases up to a moderate level of assortativity, then the effect of heterogeneity on profits remains relatively constant. The implications from these results suggest that marketing managers should consider the heterogeneity and assortativity characteristics of their customer revenue streams to (a) better manage the adverse profit impacts of customer disappointments and negative word-of-mouth; (b) design more effective customer loyalty programs; and (c) more efficiently manage their customer equity portfolios. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

It provides insights into the profitability of setting reward expiry for competing firms and identifies conditions under which such a policy would be beneficial. We develop and solve a game-theoretic model that reflects consumer behavior in choosing products and redeeming rewards. Applying a new iterative algorithm, we get the Nash equilibrium outputs for three scenarios (games): (1) neither firm sets an expiry date, (2) both firms set an expiry date, and (3) only one firm sets an expiry date. Comparison of the firms' profits across scenarios shows that the firms' prices and profits are affected by the loyalty program of the competing firm and by consumers' valuation of rewards and of time to rewards. In particular, a firm offering rewards that do not expire should increase its price if the competing firm changes its reward policy from no expiry to expiry, even when the expiry period is quite long. Finally, when customers highly value rewards and time, reward expiry is a dominant strategy for both firms. This means that firms would benefit from setting expiry on their loyalty rewards only if their customers highly value both rewards and time. Alternatively, both firms' rewards should not expire if consumers have low valuations of both rewards and time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Such restriction is commonly offered in form of ‘buy n times, get one free’ loyalty cards. We develop a multinomial logit model where consumer's utility depends on the value of the product and of the rewards. Using an iterative algorithm, we numerically solve a Nash game for two firms offering loyalty programs. Optimal strategies and profits are obtained for three different scenarios (games): (1) both firms do not restrict redemption; (2) both firms restrict redemption; and (3) only one firm restricts redemption while the other firm does not. Our main findings indicate that each firm's optimal strategies are significantly affected by whether the competitor decides to restrict or not to restrict redemption. In particular, a firm that restricts reward redemption should offer a higher price if its competitor also restricts redemption. Further, the dominant strategy of the game depends on customers’ valuations of time and rewards. For example, when customers highly value time but do not highly value rewards, the dominant strategy for both firms is not to restrict redemption. Alternatively, firms can face a Prisoner dilemma situation leading to unrestricted redemption policy for intermediate levels of customer valuation of both time and rewards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

We investigate how and why ad transparency impacts ad effectiveness. Drawing on literature about offline norms of information sharing, we posit that ad transparency backfires when it exposes marketing practices that violate norms about “information flows”—consumers’ beliefs about how their information should move between parties. Study 1 inductively shows that consumers deem information flows acceptable (or not) based on whether their personal information was: 1) obtained within versus outside of the website on which the ad appears, and 2) stated by the consumer versus inferred by the firm (the latter of each pair being less acceptable). Studies 2 and 3 show that revealing unacceptable information flows reduces ad effectiveness, which is driven by increasing consumers’ relative concern for their privacy over desire for the personalization that such targeting affords. Study 4 shows the moderating role of platform trust: when consumers trust a platform, revealing acceptable information flows increases ad effectiveness. Studies 5a and 5b, conducted in the field with a loyalty program website (i.e., a trusted platform), demonstrate this benefit of transparency. © The Author(s) 2018.

For safety during construction, agencies establish slow zones in which trains must reduce speed. Slow zones create delays and schedule disruptions that result in customer dissatisfaction and discontinued use of transit, either temporarily or permanently. While transit agencies are understandably concerned about the possible negative effects of slow zones, empirical research has not specifically examined the relationship between slow zones and ridership. This paper partially fills that gap. Using data collected from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Customer Experience Survey, CTA Slow Zone Maps, and, the Automatic Fare Collection System (AFC), it examines whether recurring service delays due to slow zones affect transit rider behavior and if the transit loyalty programs, such as smart card systems, increase or decrease rider defections. Findings suggest that slow zones increase headway deviation which reduces ridership. Smart card customers are more sensitive to slow zones as they are more likely to stop using transit as a result of delay. The findings of this paper have two major policy implications for transit agencies: (1) loyalty card users, often the most reliable source of revenue, are most at risk for defection during construction and (2) it is critical to minimize construction disruptions and delays in the long run by maintaining state of good repair. The results of this paper can likely be used as the basis for supporting immediate funding requests to bring the system to an acceptable state of good repair as well as stimulating ideas about funding reform for transit. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

In practice, service companies offer elevated status to some customers who do not meet the required spending level, in an attempt to profit from the profound allure of status. Relying on social psychology research and a mixed-method approach, this study analyzes the loyalty impact of status endowments, defined as awards of elevated status to customers who are not entitled to it. An exploratory qualitative study identifies customer gratitude and customer skepticism as positive and negative mediators, respectively, of customers’ attitudinal responses to endowed status. Quantitative studies—two experimental and one survey—substantiate these bright and dark sides of endowed status. The efficacy of status endowment is contingent on the context. To alleviate the dark-side effect, managers can allow target customers to actively choose whether to be endowed, especially those who are close to achieving the status already, and provide valuable preferential treatment to customers elevated by either endowment or achievement. These insights offer guidelines for whether and how to use status endowment in hierarchical loyalty programs. © The Author(s) 2015"

The goal of our study is to determine the impact of social media communication on hotel program loyalty. We contend that social media communication style and information quality will impact consumer social media behavior which will in turn lead to increased loyalty to hotel retention programs. Loyalty programs provide both psychological and economic value to program members. Earning rewards gives consumers a sense of appreciation and recognition. This psychological experience increases the transaction utility of a purchase and the likelihood of continuing the relationship (Lemon et al. 2002). Furthermore, it increases the overall value perception of staying in the relationship by feeling important (Bitner 1995). An additional psychological benefit of loyalty programs includes the opportunity to indulge in guilt-free luxuries (Liu 2007). Economic value is provided by the rewards that are offered to members for repeat purchase behavior. These rewards positively reinforce repeat purchase behavior and condition the customers to continue doing business with the company. Businesses which actively take part in increasing social media communication with consumers will see increases in behaviors and such increases should ultimately impact loyalty.

Loyalty programme designers can tailor their programme structure to fit their customers and overall strategy. The findings also shed light on the strategic importance of tiered loyalty programmes. Originality/valueThe examination of how a customer enters a loyalty programme is not in current literature. The research shows how loyalty intentions are impacted by design of the programme, including how a customer signs up for a programme. The mechanisms through which the relationship works increase the understanding of loyalty programme effectiveness. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

We propose that a program with two rewards can be designed in such a way that (i) it is more profitable than a one-reward program, and (ii) buyers self-select. Light users prefer to receive the smaller reward two times over receiving the larger reward one time, even though the smaller reward is less than half of the larger reward.

This paper investigates whether adopters' spending levels will change after they use a brand's app. Using a unique dataset from a coalition loyalty program with implementations of propensity score matching and difference-in-difference-in-difference methods, we compare the spending levels of app adopters with those of non-adopters. Specifically, we examine whether the use of the app's two main interactive features-information lookups and check-ins-influences adopters' spending levels. We find that app adoption and continued use of the branded app increase future spending. Furthermore, customers who adopt both features show the highest increase. However, we also observe ""the recency effect"" - when customers discontinue using the app, their spending levels decrease. Our findings suggest that sticky apps which attract continuing uses can be a persuasive marketing tool because they provide portable, convenient, and interactive engagement opportunities, allowing customers to interact with the brand on a habitual basis. We recommend that firms should prioritize launching a mobile app to communicate with their customers, but they should also keep in mind that a poorly designed app, which customers abandon after only a few uses, may in fact hurt their brand experience and company revenues. © 2015 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc."

Drawing from the social psychology literature, the theoretical framework proposes that elite status members exert a disproportionate positive influence on neighboring non-members to adopt the HLP, and that this social influence has an inverse U-shaped effect. A unique dataset from a B2B loyalty program of a firm in the agribusiness industry with detailed information on members and marketing efforts from 1378 zip codes in Germany from 2008 to 2012 is used for the analysis. The study finds that, compared to members in lower status, elite status members have a stronger social influence on non-members. Importantly, as the proportion of elite status members increases, the adoption probability of non-members increases. However, as the fraction of elite status members increases beyond a certain point, the adoption probability of non-members decreases. Overall, the results of this study advances our understanding of loyalty programs in B2B markets, particularly with regard to the drivers of loyalty program adoption and the role played by social influence in driving new member enrollment. © 2017 The Authors"

Using data from 1600 undergraduate students, this study empirically confirms the mediating role of customer gratitude between the customers' perceptions a firm's relationship marketing investments and customers' perceptions of the value of the relationship with the firm. Further, a significant moderating effect of perceived benevolence on the relationship between customers' perceptions a firm's relationship marketing investments and customer gratitude was identified. For theorists, this customer gratitude model offers a better psychological explanation of how relationship marketing investments operate to improve the value that customers place on their relationships with retailers.

An IRP is a rapidly growing form of short-term program that rewards consumers instantly with small premiums per fixed spending, where these premiums are part of a larger set of collectibles. A supplementary element in many IRPs promotes specific brands with an extra premium, labeled bonus premiums. Bonus premiums are the extra premiums consumers can earn by buying a specific promoted brand, which is a non-price promotion tied to the IRP. Therefore, consumers can earn premiums in two ways: based on total spending and on purchases of promoted brands. To test the effects of these marketing instruments, this study uses Dutch household panel data related to purchases of 23 product categories spanning four supermarket chains. We decompose consumer purchase behavior by modeling the number of shopping trips, category-level purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity. The results show that an IRP results in incremental shopping trips. Promoting a brand with a bonus premium and price discount compared to just a price discount results in higher choice probabilities for the promoted brand. Finally, the IRP and bonus premium are especially effective for households that collect the premiums, but we also find positive albeit smaller effects for non-collecting households. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The present research provides a first attempt to better understand a particular new emerging behavior which transforms the shopping experience: adoption of in-store smartphone usage to facilitate and enhance a brick-and-mortar experience. In order to probe the in-store mobile usage, we distinguish in-store mobile information search (in-store m-infosearch) which consists in collecting information about products (e.g., scanning QR codes, comparing prices) from in-store proximity mobile payment (p-m-payment), which enables customers to access and redeem coupons through their smartphone, link automatically their loyalty program membership to the m-payment app, digitally save receipts, pay quickly without queuing at the cashier, and finally load value into a store account. We aim more particularly at understanding in-store proximity m-payment as the rate of adoption appears to be still much lower than for any other mobile task (GfK 2015). Using a perceived value approach, this paper identifies utilitarian, hedonic, and social benefits as well as financial and privacy risks as key drivers of adoption for p-m-payment. A comparison between the drivers of this new in-store mobile usage and the ones for more familiar tasks such as mobile information search highlights clear differences in what drives intention, as shoppers are more experienced with the latter. In order to test our hypothesis, we sequentially expose our respondents to two shopping scenarios that are in-store information search context and in-store p-m-payment. For those two scenarios, we elicit respondents’ perceived benefits and risks associated with the use of a smartphone to perform the scenario-related task. Respondents only provide their evaluation of the perceived benefits and risks for only one scenario. We thus have a two-group survey design (the m-infosearch and p-m-payment groups). Data were collected online among GfK French panel members (ConsumerScan). We obtained a total of 363 usable questionnaires, 179 and 184 randomly assigned to the m-infosearch group and to the p-m-payment group, respectively. We did not find any statistical difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, education, and occupation. Our results highlight the importance of perceived benefits and in particular convenience and enjoyment as well as perceived risks to explain intention to use p-m-payment. Findings also underline a clear difference between p-m-payment and m-infosearch. While using a smartphone to scan a product or read online reviews is becoming familiar, paying with a smartphone still needs to be encouraged with a clear understanding of perceived value. Thus, the main drivers of perceived value have a stronger impact on m-p-m as opposed to m-infosearch. Finally, we highlight the importance of the experience effect in the m-infosearch and p-m-payment adoption. This study has implications for managers by providing a set of potential levers which retailers can use to encourage p-m-payment adoption. Retailers should focus on unique functional, hedonic, and social benefits to help users better understand the added value of p-m-payment. The main limitation of this research is the generalization because it focuses on shopping for a compact camera and thus for a single product category. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

Several provincial studies have been conducted in order to understand the pharmacists’ perceptions of incentive and loyalty programmes. To date, no known Canadian study investigates the perceptions of incentive and loyalty programmes from that of the general public. Methods: This study uses data collected, via telephone survey, from members of the public in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan to explore the perception of incentive and loyalty programmes, and the ethical and professional parameters surrounding offering incentives and loyalty programmes. Key findings: Results suggest that members of the general public perceive patient care to be unaffected by the offering of incentive and loyalty programmes. The vast majority of respondents reported that they did not behave or make decisions based on incentives and loyalty programmes that impacted their health. Less than half of the respondents viewed it ethical for pharmacists to provide incentive and loyalty programmes; however, the majority disagreed that offering incentive and loyalty programmes made pharmacists or pharmacies less trustworthy. Conclusions: The results suggest that patients are able to discern the complex nature (e.g. professional and business orientations) of pharmacists and the pharmacy industry, perceiving their care to be unaffected by incentive and loyalty programmes.

In order to clarify the relationships among these constructs, a structural equation model (SEM) is employed to examine the model fit and the five hypotheses. The results show that strategic planning is critical for small independent retailers due to its influence on the retailer-supplier relationship and consumer loyalty program. Besides, consumer loyalty program is also influenced by functional-business strategy. The retailer-supplier relationship and consumer loyalty program exhibits a positive influence on the small-independent retailer performance. The research supports the existence of a more complex that the consumer loyalty program fully mediates the relationships between strategic planning and functional-business strategy on retail performance. Moreover, the retailer-supplier relationship fully mediates the relationship between strategic planning and small retailer performance.

Design/methodology/approach: The study introduces a self-congruity theory-based structural equation model, which is validated through an online sample of 575 respondents. The model begins with communication style and investigates its impact on satisfaction and loyalty in relation to hotel loyalty program members. Findings: The model confirms that different forms of communication have varying levels of relevance to program loyalty. Communication style, information quality, self-congruity and satisfaction are all significant predictors of program loyalty. Practical implications: Management can cultivate a community of loyal program members through the recognition of self-image congruence and its relationship with communication style, along with a solid understanding of target markets.

A recent study by Liu (2007) on the long -term impact of loyalty programs on consumer purchase behaviour and loyalty found that loyalty programs do not affect the purchasing behaviour of heavy users, although it increased the purchase behaviour of light users. Similarly, few other studies (e.g. Lara & De Madrariaga, 2007) have looked at the importance of rewards vis-à-vis the profile of the consumers, and. the impact of loyalty programs under different conditions of market saturation, market share, and category expandability (Liu & Yang, 2009). Some of the key loyalty-marketing trends have been already identified and explored in detail (Capizzi & Ferguson, 2005). Loyalty reward point programs have been in operation in the credit card market for several decades now. Liu and Yang (2009) reported that in the credit card industry, half of general-purpose credit cards offer a reward program. Mägi (2003) notes that despite the customer loyalty reward programs in this industry reaching a stage maturity, the multiplicity of the loyalty program memberships may also allow having fair judgement to individual programs. Reflecting this concern, academic research also has expressed doubts about the value of such loyalty programs to firms (e.g., Dowling & Uncles, 1997; Shugan, 2005). Several scholars have also suggested that delayed rewards in a loyalty program have a significantly different impact on customer loyalty (e.g., Leenheer & Bijmolt, 2008). According to Bolton, Kannan, and Bramlett (2000), credit card users belonging to any reward programs spend more using their cards than non-members, but were not more likely to retain their accounts over time, i.e., the programs increase usage but do not appear to build loyalty. There are essentially three types of rewards programs for credit card users: point-based, cash back, and airline miles, with some cards offering combinations of these. The current research focuses on point -based programs. Benefits of reward points from using a credit card are dependent on the program selected by the customer, but can include free flights, free accommodation, electronic equipment, vouchers and gift certificates to major retailers, magazine subscriptions, passes to major theme parks, etc. Despite its higher returns, consumers find the redemption procedure of point- based rewards to be too much trouble - instead preferring the simplicity of automatic cash back credit (Liu, 2009). For example, unlike cash back cards, point-based reward cards usually require card holders to keep track of their points and submit requests when they qualify for point redemption. Point-based rewards usually expire if not redeemed within a fixed time period. Further, the rate of return (“redemption ratio”) of some point-based reward programs varies considerably depending on what is redeemed; retailer vouchers may carry a higher return than gasoline, for example. Compared with the complexity of point-based reward programs, and the implicit need for customers to manage their accounts, customers with cash back credit cards automatically get a portion of their purchases back as statement credits or a cash back checks after a certain period of time. Besides, Van et al. (2004) and O’Brien and Jones (1995) have found that the manner in which the structure of the point reward system also impacts redemption behaviour by consumers. However, past research has dealt with issues related to characteristics of rewards and their impact, mostly in the developed countries. However, there is limited empirical research in emerging markets that explores whether credit card reward point programs enhance customer loyalty. Moreover, there is also little understanding of the degree to which credit card users actually value reward point programs in emerging markets such as India. The early 1990s witnessed a quantum growth in the Indian credit card industry. Not surprisingly, credit cards have found greater acceptance and usage in major metropolitan cities of India. Increased competition has helped accelerate growth of the Indian credit card market, one result of which is more options for Indian customers. Collectively, credit card companies have also helped increase the overall acceptability of plastic, and hence usage. In 2009, the total number of credit cards in India was estimated to be 24.4 millions (Schulz, 2009) with 14 major banks and financial institutions providing credit card products and services. With increasing numbers of credit card issuers and increasing competition, several Indian banks are entering into joint ventures with international brands such as MasterCard and Visa (Mukherjee, 2006). According to Visa, the largest credit card type in India, India is one of the fastest growing markets worldwide, and it is estimated to be the fourth largest market in the Asia Pacific region (The Economic Times, 2006). In such growing and vibrant credit card market in India, it is important to understand if loyalty programs offered by the credit card companies actually work, and to what extent. This paper studies the impact of credit card loyalty reward point programs on the purchasing behaviour of Indian credit card users. A total of over 100 valid responses were collected using an online survey of Indian credit card users. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

The present article questions this claim by examining the moderating role of brand concept. Building on the congruence principle, two studies—a survey involving various empirical contexts and an experiment conducted in the banking sector—reveal that the effect of perceived congruence between the program structure and the brand concept is asymmetrical. For symbolic brands, hierarchical loyalty program structures appear more congruent, which increases loyalty intentions. In contrast, for functional brands, both hierarchical and linear loyalty program structures seem equally congruent. The findings enrich the general debate about loyalty program designs and provide practical guidance to brand and loyalty program managers. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

The initial goal of loyalty programs is to “establish a higher level of customer retention in profitable segments by providing increased satisfaction and value to certain customers” (Bolton, Kannan, and Bramlett 2000, page 95). In doing so, it is suggested that when a consumer feels connected with a loyalty program, he/she will feel benefits of the loyalty program more, and engage in more participation in the program. However, empirical research on loyalty programs from a consumer’s membership identity perspective is lacking. Therefore, a few questions arise: Does a retailer’s loyalty program elicit a consumer-retailer relationship? And, what factors of a loyalty program can make a consumer feel connected with the retailer? To answer these questions, this study focuses on the role of salience of the identity (the activation of an identity as a patronage shopper of the store) as a member of the loyalty program in consumer-retailer relationship formation. More specifically, this study examines (1) the effects of two identity-inducing factors of a loyalty program (self-expression and distinctiveness) on the salience of identity as a member of a certain loyalty program and (2) the effects of identity salience on satisfaction, trust, and loyalty intention toward the retailer offering the loyalty program. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science."

Initial transactions with new customers are less profitable than transactions with existing customers, making loyalty an important strategy. Drawing on research examining online customer loyalty (termed e-loyalty), switching costs, and trust, this study provides an empirical test of the relative influence of trust vs switching costs on e-loyalty for e-service providers. We further examine whether trust moderates the relationship between switching costs and e-loyalty. We propose that in the presence of high customer trust, e-service providers should have less need to rely on switching costs as a driver of e-loyalty. We test the hypothesized relationships using data collected from 299 repeat users of online travel services. Our results confirm that trust is a more important predictor of e-loyalty than switching costs. In addition, we find that the impact of switching costs on e-loyalty depends on the level of trust felt by customers. This study extends our understanding of customer loyalty, switching costs, and trust in e-commerce environments and provides practical, theory-driven guidelines to e-businesses seeking to develop customer loyalty programmes. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Last year, the architecture and design firm was focused on green building initiatives. This year, Ruth says, is the year of customer loyalty. Toward the end of her keynote remarks, she introduces two kickoff projects. The goals of one, Project Holding Pattern, sound familiar to Ralston's Guy Christiano; if the project team structures its loyalty program to look like the one he'd been associated with in his previous job, it could be a boon for the company. ""Why didn't they put me on that project?"" he wonders. ""Then again,"" Guy figures, ""I've got plenty to do already."" Several weeks after the conference, Guy is contacted by a member of the project team. Guy's ready to share the key success factors for the loyalty program he'd been involved with before: a marketing initiative that looks like a service offering. But what the team is proposing sounds more like a run-of-the-mill seminar series. Against his mentor's advice, Guy calls team leader Charyl Urquhart to make the case for a different approach, going so far as to e-mail her his suggested outline for the program. Miffed, Charyl cuts the call short and never follows up. Guy considers going over her head, to McViney.

Two potential avenues for increasing customer share are to raise customer satisfaction, and increase repeat purchase through loyalty cards. This study examines the effects of customer satisfaction and loyalty cards as well as consumer characteristics on customer share spent on the primary grocery store. The findings suggest that customer satisfaction has a positive, albeit modest, effect on share while consumer economic shopping orientation has a negative direct effect on share. The economic orientation of shoppers, their felt importance of a personal relationship with store personnel, and the level of their aggregate purchase volume moderate the effect of satisfaction on customer share.

Panel data were used to develop Dirichlet estimates of expected repeat-purchase loyalty statistics by brand. These estimates were compared with the observed market repeat-purchase behaviour. Overall a trend towards a weak level of excess loyalty was observed, although the expected deviation was not consistently observed for all the loyalty program brands.

At first, this research appears consistent with firm practices. However, close scrutiny reveals disaffirming evidence. Many current so-called loyalty programs appear unrelated to the cultivation of customer brand loyalty and the creation of customer assets. True investments are up-front expenditures that produce much greater future returns. In contrast, many so-called loyalty programs are shams because they produce liabilities (e.g., promises of future rewards or deferred rebates) rather than assets. These programs produce short-term revenue from customers while producing substantial future obligations to those customers. Rather than showing trust by committing to the customer, the firm asks the customer, to trust the firm - that is, trust that future rewards are indeed forthcoming. The entire idea is antithetical to the concept of a customer asset. Many modern loyalty programs resemble old-fashioned trading stamps or deferred rebates that promise future benefits for current patronage. A true loyalty program invests in the customer (e.g., provides free up-front training, allows familiarization or customization) with the expectation of greater future revenue.

Using the case of frequency (or loyalty) programs, a series of five studies involving both real and hypothetical choices demonstrated that (a) the presence (as opposed to absence) of effort requirements enhances the preference for sure-small rewards over large-uncertain rewards; (b) the preference for reward certainty is attenuated when the effort activity is intrinsically motivating; and (c) continuously increasing the effort level leads to an inverted-U effect on the preference for sure-small over large-uncertain rewards. The studies also employ process measures and examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of the effort stream on the trade-off between the certainty and magnitude of rewards.

The cross-buying behavior then reinforces the customer's relationship with the core service, as cross-buying positively influences future purchases of the core service.

In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the ""idiosyncratic fit heuristic,"" whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences."

There are now some industries in which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty programs has often studied such programs in a non-competitive setting and has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap, this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program. Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover, when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with competing programs. However, when the product category is highly expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations, loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation. © 2009, American Marketing Association."

Testifying to its practical importance, expressing the energy content of snacks in kilojoules rather than kilocalories increases the choice of a healthy snack. The unit effect occurs because consumers focus on the number rather than the type of units in which information is expressed (numerosity effect). Therefore, reminding consumers of alternative units in which information can be expressed eliminates the unit effect.

The main objective is to examine its impact on various aspects of consumer purchase behavior and a retailer's sales revenue. They find that after a retailer switched from a conventional LP to the IBLP, consumers became more responsive to reward point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value, were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. In addition, the new LP had a significantly different impact on ""current"" LP members and nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group, under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under the new LP to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk alienating their loyal customers.

When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i.e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a profitability perspective, rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage.

The results, to date, indicate that loyalty does indeed raise the price that consumers are willing to pay for a brand. Other than this broad finding, however, there has been little research in the literature regarding whether and how this relationship varies across consumers and product categories and, within consumers, over time. This is the issue that we investigate in this paper. Specifically, we examine whether the price sensitivity-loyalty relationship is heterogeneous and dynamic. We propose an approach wherein the price sensitivity parameter of a brand choice model is specified as a function of loyalty with three parameters. The first parameter of this function represents the maximum possible reduction in price sensitivity due to loyalty. The second parameter affects the type and shape of the relationship between price sensitivity and loyalty. In particular, depending on the value of this parameter, the relationship could be non-existent, follow a concave shape, indicating decreasing response to increases in loyalty, or be S-shaped to capture the case of increasing response initially followed by decreasing response subsequently. Finally, the third parameter captures the rate at which price sensitivity falls as loyalty increases. We use the proposed approach to investigate the relationship in four frequently purchased categories. In each category, we select a sample of households and calibrate the model on the choices of all the households in the sample. We next employ an Empirical Bayes approach to obtain household-level estimates of all the parameters. These parameters are then used to assign each household in each category to a no response or concave or S-shaped response groups. Within each of these three groups, we assign each household to one of four different response level and rate segments, that is, high response-high rate, high response-low rate, low response-high rate, and low response-low rate. Each of these segments differs in the response level, that is, the maximum reduction in price sensitivity as loyalty reaches a maximum-and the response rate , that is, how quickly price sensitivity falls with increases in loyalty. Following the assignment of each household to a segment in each category, we pool the households across all four categories and calibrate a membership function. This function explains households' membership in different segments in terms of product category characteristics, household demographics, the household's responses to price, display, and feature promotions and the evolution of loyalty of the household. Our findings suggest that the nature of the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship does vary across consumers as well as over time. Specifically, the concave response is more likely than the S-shaped response or the absence of a response. We find that the S-shaped response is not related to responsiveness to in-store promotions. It is, however, associated with a slower growth in loyalty to a brand as it is purchased. The concave response, on the other hand, is associated with responsiveness to feature promotions but is unrelated to how loyalty to brands evolves with their purchases. We also find that demographic characteristics are related to the behavior of the concave and S-shaped responses. Specifically, for the S-shaped response, household demographics are related to both the maximum level of the curve as well as its rate of growth. In particular, the curve grows faster with age and its maximum increases with the weekly working hours of the household. In the case of the concave response, high income and more working hours raise the maximum level that the curve achieves. Its rate of growth, however, is unaffected by demographics. We also provide several managerial implications for loyalty and promotional programs based on our findings. Specifically, our first finding-that the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship is dynamic-suggests that, rather than having promotional programs, where the value of the price promotion is fixed and some consumers are targeted with the promotion while others are not, managers should have an entire schedule of price promotions with each level of promotions targeting consumers at a different loyalty level. Our second finding that the nature of the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship is heterogeneous across consumers suggests that designing loyalty programs on the basis of crude classifications such as loyals and non-loyals is not appropriate. Instead, households that are identified as loyal, need to be further divided based on how the loyalty affects their price sensitivity. Promotional programs should then be based on the specific type of relationship that a household exhibits. The third finding that the reductions in price sensitivity to loyalty can exhibit an S-shaped or a concave pattern also has an interesting managerial implication. Specifically, given the differences between the two patterns in how long it might take a consumer to reach a point where s(he) is willing to purchase a brand due to loyalty rather than due to a price promotion, and hence be a profitable customer, it may be preferable for managers to invest more in consumers who exhibit a concave rather than an S-shaped response. Finally, our result that different categories may exhibit different patterns of the relationship between price sensitivity and loyalty implies that each category needs to be analyzed by itself for what the nature of the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship is likely to be so that the most appropriate program for that category can be developed. © 2003 New York University.

Specifically, the aim of our research was to test whether loyalty program structure affects status perceptions in more and less exclusive industries, and among consumers with more and less positive attitudes toward loyalty programs.An experimental design based on different scenarios was used. Two industries and three loyalty program structures were examined. In the airline industry, which is higher in perceived exclusivity, perceived status in the top tier of the loyalty program increased as the number of customers in the top tier decreased and as the number of tiers increased. Notably, however, loyalty program structure had no effect on perceived status in the supermarket industry, which is lower in perceived exclusivity. Moreover, even in the airline industry, status effects were only observed among respondents with a positive attitude toward loyalty programs. Those with neutral or negative attitudes toward loyalty programs were unaffected by the structure of the loyalty program.

The responsiveness may be improved if multiple communication channels are used jointly to present an individual-vendor promotion. Moreover, this is one of the first empirical studies to investigate potential networking benefits of coalitions in an MVLP. Empirical evidence of coalition benefits of promotions is lacking, because we find neither stronger effects for joint-relative to individual promotions nor significant spillover effects of promotions across vendors (i. e., cross-vendor effects). The current study offers potential explanations for these findings. © 2010 The Author(s)."

Across three experiments and a field study, we find a coherent pattern of gender differences in the way customers respond to different types of psychological rewards in the context of loyalty programs.

Many researchers have worked at understanding the impact of loyalty programs on market competition and the mechanism behind it. Interestingly, almost all of the studies have explored a symmetric equilibrium where both of the competing firms offer a loyalty program. To our knowledge, the extant literature has not investigated in-depth whether asymmetric equilibrium can exist where only one firm chooses to offer a loyalty program and the other firm chooses to compete via lowering prices. Such a question is important because some markets do support such asymmetric equilibriums with respect to loyalty programs. Also, the existence of asymmetric equilibrium shows that a loyalty program need not be profitable for some firms. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to investigate specific types of customer loyalty programs that provide benefit to loyal customers in the form of discount over market prices. The model considers consumer switching and includes two types of consumer heterogeneity. The first type of heterogeneity concerns the differences between customers with respect to their liking for loyalty programs, and the second type concerns the differences among the loyalty program members with respect to their ability to collect enough loyalty points to redeem loyalty rewards. By analyzing a duopoly market, we find that both symmetric equilibrium (i.e., where both competing firms offer the loyalty program) and asymmetric equilibrium (i.e., where one firm alone offers the loyalty program) can be sustained. The paper explores conditions for the existence of these two equilibriums. © 2008 INFORMS."

From a first-order Markov brand-switching model, serial equations are derived to estimate the retention rate using market share and loyalty. To explore the impact of loyalty and promotion programme on retention rate, data from five leading brands for three product categories were obtained to fit the developed model. Findings suggest that: (1) when the loyalty effect remains unchanged over a period of time, the greater the effect of a promotion programme, the greater the retention rate; (2) when the promotion effects among brands are similar, the retention rate varies depending on level of loyalty; and (3) when the proportion of loyal customers is high, the proportion of potential switchers affected by promotion programmes is low. In this case, the impact of a promotion programme on the retention rate is not significant.

Concrete reasoning also has strong implications for the execution and presentation of price promotions through coupons and in-store discounts, because many consumers are unable to process the information and thus avoid discounted products.

In higher-magnitude (vs. lower-magnitude) programs, both reward distances (1,000 vs. 100) and step sizes (10 vs. 1 point[s]/dollar) are larger. How do these two pieces of information affect consumers' postenrollment inferences of progress, store loyalty, and recommendation likelihood? Do consumers always integrate both pieces? We identify a moderator, step-size ambiguity, and show that when ambiguity is high, only reward distance affects inferences. When ambiguity is lower, consumers integrate step size with reward distance, but in a biased manner.

A field study using proprietary sales data from a different industry context demonstrates the robustness of the negative impact of customer demotion.

As such, loyalty programs encourage consumers to shift from myopic or single-period decision making to dynamic or multiple-period decision making. In this study, the author models customers' response to a loyalty program under the assumption that purchases represent the sequential choices of customers who are solving a dynamic optimization problem. The author estimates the theoretical model using a discrete-choice dynamic programming formulation. The author evaluates a specific loyalty program with data from an online merchant that specializes in grocery and drugstore items.

The attractiveness of a reward program, on the other hand, has a positive impact on share of wallet regardless of the level of psychological attachment to the company. These findings are particularly important for service providers in markets characterized by undifferentiated product offerings and low perceived switching costs between service providers. © 2007 Sage Publicaitons."

We provide an integrated analysis of a loyalty program incorporating customers' purchase and cash-in decisions, points pressure and rewarded behavior effects, heterogeneity, and forward-looking behavior. We focus on four key research questions: (1) How important is it to combine both components in one model? (2) Does points pressure exist in the context of a two-component loyalty program? (3) How is the market segmented in its response to the combined program? (4) Do the programs complement each other in terms of the incremental sales they produce? Our most basic message is that the frequency reward and customer tier components of loyalty programs should be modeled jointly rather than in separate models. We find strong evidence for points pressure for both the customer tier and frequency reward components using both model-based and model-free evidence. We find a two-segment solution revealing a ""service-oriented"" segment that highly values cash-ins for room upgrades and staying in ""luxury"" hotels, and a ""price-oriented"" segment that is more price sensitive and highly values the frequency reward aspects of the loyalty program. Furthermore, we find that both components generate incremental sales. Also, there was slight synergy between the programs but not a huge amount.

Then, loyalty-based consumer segment are used to explain why the budgeting exercise can achieve the maximization objective. To this end, the study uses consumer panel data concerning three categories, namely, adult milk powder, shampoo, and detergent.

Findings from a series of experiments indicate that the incentive that is offered in a loyalty program is important to whether the program succeeds or fails at building brand loyalty. The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations."

How can that be? These days, everyone knows that an old customer retained is worth more than a new customer won. What is so hard about making a simple loyalty program work? Quite a lot, the authors say. The biggest challenges include clarifying business goals, engineering the reward structure, and creating incentives powerful enough to change buying behavior but not so generous that they erode margins. Additionally, companies have to sort out the puzzles of consumer psychology, which can result, for example, in two rewards of equal economic value inspiring very different levels of purchasing. In their research, the authors have discovered patterns in what the successful loyalty programs get right and in how the others fail. Together, their findings constitute a tool kit for designing something rare indeed: a program that won't do you wrong. To begin with, it's important to know exactly what a loyalty program can do. It can keep customers from defecting, induce them to consolidate certain purchases with one seller (in other words, win a greater share of wallet), prompt customers to make additional purchases, yield insight into their behavior and preferences, and turn a profit. A program can meet these objectives in several ways-for instance, by offering rewards (points, say, or frequent-flier miles) divisible enough to provide many redemption opportunities but not so divisible that they fail to lock in customers. Companies striving to generate customer loyalty should avoid five common mistakes: Don't create a new commodity, which can result in price wars and other tit-for-tat competitive moves; don't cater to the disloyal by making rewards easy for just anyone to reap; don't reward purchasing volume over profitability; don't give away the store; and, finally, don't promise what can't be delivered."

Technology readiness (TR), i.e. the customer's mental readiness to accept new technologies, has been proposed as such a factor. TR comprises four dimensions: innovativeness, optimism, discomfort and insecurity. This article investigates the effects of TR on customers' (1) attitudes towards using SST for airline check-in, (2) adoption of self-service check-in, and (3) evaluations of a new self-service check-in on the Internet, in terms of perceived service quality, satisfaction and loyalty. An empirical study was conducted among loyalty program customers of a European airline, having access to Internet check-in. Data were collected with online and traditional mail surveys, resulting in 1258 usable responses. Analysis of the data revealed that only optimism and innovativeness formed unique individual dimensions. Furthermore, TR had surprisingly little impact on customer attitudes towards SST, on adoption behaviour, and on SST evaluations. Optimism explained consumer behaviour towards SSTs best, whereas innovativeness had only a marginal effect on attitudes towards using the Internet or a mobile phone to check-in.

Design/methodology/approach: The method used was a consumer survey. Two waves of cross-sectional telephone interviewing with 116 and 410 members of a retail loyalty club were conducted. Structural equation modelling served for the estimation of relationships in an integrated conceptual framework among constructs of loyalty programme quality, personal interaction quality, relationship quality and loyalty, relevant to the development of retail relationships. Findings: The findings suggest that loyalty programme quality is important for relationship quality; however, efforts to assure personal interaction quality with customers are needed to improve relationship quality as well as customer loyalty. The study deepens knowledge of relationship quality's antecedents and consequences in the retail environment with regard to segments of customers with different levels of product category involvement. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to members of a selected DIY retailer's loyalty programme, not accounting specifically for membership in multiple loyalty programmes.

Therefore, there is no surprise that it is one of the most widely studied areas by researchers and one of the most widely implemented marketing initiatives by practitioners. This article draws upon past research to review important findings related to customer behavior and attitude in the context of customer loyalty. Further, research related to linking loyalty to profitability and forward looking metric such as the customer lifetime value is reviewed to propose a conceptual framework for building and sustaining loyalty and profitability simultaneously at individual customer level. A two-tiered rewards structure is presented as a means for marketers to operationalize the framework. The conceptual framework hopes to serve as a platform to understand the evolving dominant logic of loyalty programs for building and sustaining loyalty in the twenty first century as well as induce further research in that direction. © 2004 New York University.

The change in the firm's customer equity is the change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors' drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising, return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship, given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the greatest return."

Data were collected from 400 cardholders of a retail loyalty program in Klang Valley, Malaysia via the drop-off-and-collect technique. Structural modelling techniques were applied to analyze the data. The results indicated that program satisfaction is not related to store loyalty (share-of-wallet, share-of-visit and store preference).

The CELM technology combines advanced models of Markov decision processes (MDPs), Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio optimization. MDPs are used to model customer dynamics and to find optimal marketing policies that maximize the value generated by a customer over a given time horizon. Lifetime value optimization is achieved through dynamic programming algorithms that identify which marketing actions, such as cross-selling, up-selling, and loyalty marketing campaigns, transition customers to better value and loyalty states. The CELM technology can also be used to simulate the financial impact of a given marketing policy using Monte Carlo simulation. This allows marketing managers to simulate several targeting scenarios to assess budget requirements and the expected impact of a given marketing policy. The benefits of the solution are illustrated with the Finnair case study, where CELM has been used to optimize marketing planning and budgeting for Finnair's frequent-flyer program (FFP). © 2007 INFORMS."

The authors model each group's contribution as the number of daily buyers times their average expenditures. The model also includes the number of nonbuyers because they may return as customers. Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use personnel time. Model application to two years of daily data from six clothing stores reveals that the number of nonmembers who buy is much more responsive to price discounts than the number of members who buy. Thus, the decomposition of the promotional revenue bump is strongly moderated by the percentage price discount and the communication mode: direct mail to members only and door-to-door flyers to members and nonmembers. © 2005, American Marketing Association."

To test the hypotheses, we surveyed 180 retail companies active in 15 retail sectors, 37% of which have a loyalty program. The survey data are complemented with expert judgements on sector characteristics. We estimate multi-level models for both loyalty program adoption and perceived effectiveness (tobit-2 specification). We find that the sector characteristics assortment homogeneity and average purchase frequency stimulate loyalty program adoption considerably. Further, customer-oriented firms are most likely to adopt loyalty programs. Contrary to loyalty program adoption, the effectiveness of a loyalty program in terms of additional customer knowledge and customer loyalty is hardly affected by market and organizational factors. But it appears that retail companies should better take into account their technological skills necessary for obtaining useful information from the customer loyalty program data. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There may be several unique segments within a loyalty program, and significant managerial implications may accrue from identification of these segments and analysis of differences among them. This paper aims to investigate the potential for deriving meaningful, managerially relevant customer segments within a retail loyalty-type program. Design/methodology/approach: Data from the one-year test of a retail loyalty card program by a major US retailer were used to derive patronage-based segments and explore determinants of segment differences and strategy implications. A numerical taxonomy process was used to group 57,650 loyalty-card program members into distinct segments. Cluster analysis was used to generate a range of potential market structures on a set of managerially relevant variables. The most appropriate market structure was selected using scree testing and discriminant analysis. Each of the resulting six segments was named profiled. Finally, a set of patronage-related variables was regressed on to the clusters using multinomial logistic regression. Findings: The results indicate that, at least for this card program, clearly defined segments with unique patronage profiles do exist both descriptively and statistically; only a small percentage of loyalty card program members demonstrate behaviors that can be considered truly loyal; and different marketing strategies appear appropriate to try and increase patronage among the segments based on their profile characteristics. Originality/value: This study should prove valuable to academic researchers as well as managers. It is the first effort to generate meaningful, rigorously derived segments within a large loyalty program. It shows that behavioral variables can yield managerially relevant segments, and that the segments appear to call for individualized strategy initiatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, they frequently ignore variations in consumption that lead to cash flow variability and adversely influence service operations and financial performance. This study shows that variation in individual customers' consumption or spending on services can be decreased in ways that are actionable by most managers, without decreasing revenues or profits. First, customer satisfaction has a double-whammy effect: lower cash flow variability and higher cash flow levels. This finding is important because firms can increase satisfaction in many ways. Second, customers who participate in loyalty programs have more variable cash flows, but not higher average cash flows. Hence, firms should design loyalty programs to improve customer satisfaction or intangible benefits (e.g., membership recognition), rather than offering economic incentives. Third, customers who purchase many different offerings, or allocate a large share of their purchases to the firm, have higher cash flow variability and higher average cash flows. Firms can optimize the customer portfolio by combining customers with high variability with customers who have different, offsetting cash flow patterns. Fourth, personal characteristics, such as age and income, also influence cash flow variability. Empirical findings are robust across two settings: telecommunications and financial services. The study describes sensitivity analyses of how different service and relationship marketing strategies influence a firm's business outcomes. The article concludes with insights into how to integrate service management principles, which emphasize consistency or low variability in processes, with customer relationship management principles that emphasize growing relationships and cash flows. © The Author(s) 2012."

Structural equation modelling was used to build a model that can be used to explain the simultaneous structural relations between perceived benefits, emotional feelings, and loyalty behaviours. Invariance testing was applied in order to test whether the model holds across the five countries. Our findings suggest that perceived benefits have a weak direct effect on loyalty behaviours. However, perceived benefits have a much stronger effect on feelings, which in turn have a strong effect on loyalty behaviours.

In this paper, we investigate the financial benefits of and computational challenges involved in one-to-one marketing. The analysis uses data from an online grocery and drug retailer. Like many retailers, this firm uses multiple promotional instruments including discount coupons, free shipping offers, and a loyalty program. We investigate the impact of customizing these promotions on the two most important consumer decisions: the decision to buy from the store and expenditure. Our modeling approach accounts for two sources of heterogeneity in consumers' responsiveness to various marketing mix elements: cross-sectional differences across consumers and temporal differences within consumers based on the purchase cycle. The model parameter estimates are fed into a dynamic programming model that determines the optimal number, sequence, and timing of promotions to maximize retailer profits. A series of policy simulations show that customizing promotions leads to a significant increase in profits relative to the firm's current practice of uniform promotions. However, the effectiveness of various promotions varies because of both cross-sectional differences in consumers as well within consumer heterogeneity due to purchase cycle factors. For instance, we find that free shipping tends to be the preferred instrument for re-acquiring lapsed customers, whereas an across-the-board price cut (via a discount coupon) is the most effective tool for managing the segment of most active customers. Interestingly, we find that customizing based on withincustomer temporal heterogeneity contributes more to profitability than exploiting variations across consumers. This is important because the computational burden of implementing the dynamic optimization to account for cross-sectional heterogeneity is far greater than accounting for temporal heterogeneity. Furthermore, targeting promotions based only on timing rather than the nature and magnitude of the offers across consumers alleviates the public relations risks of price discrimination. Implications for marketing managers are also discussed. © 2009 INFORMS."

The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low, consumers are primarily concerned about the question ""Can I get there?"" Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question ""When will I get there?"" and focus more on whether they are effectively reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment. Empirical evidence from lab and field experiments supports this hypothesis. © 2011 American Marketing Association."

Different allocations of the same quantity of points across the same number of purchases (e.g., 100 points for each first, 200 for each second, 300 for each third purchase vs. 200 for each first, second, and third purchase) yielded irrelevant trends and should have led participants to ignore loyalty points as a basis for choice. However, choices were influenced by points even when consumers were provided with other truly discriminating information (e.g., price) and the irrelevance of the loyalty points was readily discernable. This implies that irrelevant information can influence choice when other, easily justifiable bases for decisions are available and, therefore, that irrelevant information can function as more than a tie-breaker. Other implications for research on irrelevant attributes, medium effects, intertemporal choice, and loyalty programs are discussed."

We consider five aspects: price sensitivity, search for variety, shopping enjoyment, attitude toward loyalty schemes, and one personality trait: privacy concerns. Some of these variables have already been explored in the literature. Where our research breaks new ground is in establishing the difference between profiles of customers attracted by two of the most common types of loyalty programs currently used by grocery retail firms: a reward program and a loyalty card. The two kinds of program evidence differences in how they are managed, and we posit that the drivers of likelihood to take part in each are different. The study was carried out using logistic regression with a sample of 600 clients of a Spanish supermarket chain. Findings show that one particular type of customer is more likely to take part in these schemes: those displaying little shopping enjoyment, who are greatly concerned with privacy, and who show a favorable attitude toward loyalty programs in general. Furthermore, as expected, differences were observed between drivers of participation likelihood in reward programs and loyalty cards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Loyalty program members may have a much higher share-of-wallet at the firm with the loyalty program than non-members have, but this does not necessarily imply that loyalty programs are effective. Loyal customers may select themselves to become members in order to benefit from the program. Since this implies that program membership is endogenous, we estimate models for both the membership decision (using instrumental variables) and for the effect of membership on share-of-wallet, our measure of behavioral loyalty. We use panel data from a representative sample of Dutch households who report their loyalty program memberships for all seven loyalty programs in grocery retailing as well as their expenditures at each of the 20 major supermarket chains. We find a small positive yet significant effect of loyalty program membership on share-of-wallet. This effect is seven times smaller than is suggested by a naïve model that ignores the endogeneity of program membership. The predictive validity of the proposed model is much better than for the naïve model. Our results show that creating loyalty program membership is a crucial step to enhance share-of-wallet, and we provide guidelines on how to achieve this. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
