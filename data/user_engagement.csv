Despite this increase in popularity, there is a dearth of empirical studies that examine the factors influencing the continued usage intention of these applications (hereafter, apps). Drawing on stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory, this paper investigates the features of stock trading apps that generate consumer engagement and consequently, continued app usage intention. In study 1, through semi-structured interviews, we establish four key drivers of customer engagement with stock trading apps, and two possible moderators influencing the relationship between customer app engagement and continued usage intention. In study 2, we examine these key drivers by surveying stock trading app users from three different Facebook stock trading communities. The results confirm that the social presence and security features of these apps are significantly associated with consumer stock trading app engagement. We also find that fear of uncertainty and perceived corporate hypocrisy weaken the effect of customer app engagement on continued app usage intention. The study findings add to the literature on app usage and customer engagement and provide insights for fintech service companies to help them understand the factors that enhance consumer engagement with these apps. © 2024"

This study adopted the perspective of social influence to examine its effectiveness in social media advertising. This study employed content analysis to examine the content and product types of Facebook advertising. This study developed a program and collected brand-related advertising on Facebook over 3 months after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results showed that content value exerted a significant effect on online engagement with utilitarian and hedonic products. These findings encourage advertisers to plan advertising strategies that stimulate the user’s activity and enhance the brand performance on Facebook. Moreover, the results motivate advertisers to develop user engagement strategies and then increase the interactivity and brand loyalty of users. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Despite this, many users seem to regret the time they spend on these platforms. One possible explanation is that incentives are misaligned: platforms are not optimizing for user happiness. We suggest the problem runs deeper, transcending the specific incentives of any particular platform, and instead stems from a mistaken foundational assumption. To understand what users want, platforms look at what users do. This is a kind of revealed-preference assumption that is ubiquitous in the way user models are built. Yet research has demonstrated, and personal experience affirms, that we often make choices in the moment that are inconsistent with what we actually want. The behavioral economics and psychology literatures suggest, for example, that we can choose mindlessly or that we can be too myopic in our choices, behaviors that feel entirely familiar on online platforms. In this work, we develop a model of media consumption where users have inconsistent preferences. We consider a platform which wants to maximize user utility, but only observes behavioral data in the form of the user's engagement. We show how our model of users' preference inconsistencies produces phenomena that are familiar from everyday experience but difficult to capture in traditional user interaction models. These phenomena include users who have long sessions on a platform but derive very little utility from it, and platform changes that steadily raise user engagement before abruptly causing users to go “cold turkey” and quit. A key ingredient in our model is a formulation for how platforms determine what to show users: they optimize over a large set of potential content (the content manifold) parametrized by underlying features of the content. Whether improving engagement improves user welfare depends on the direction of movement in the content manifold: For certain directions of change, increasing engagement makes users less happy, whereas in other directions on the same manifold, increasing engagement makes users happier. We provide a characterization of the structure of content manifolds for which increasing engagement fails to increase user utility. By linking these effects to abstractions of platform design choices, our model thus creates a theoretical framework and vocabulary in which to explore interactions between design, behavioral science, and social media.

We find that visuals in firms’ Twitter earnings announcements are associated with more retweets, consistent with greater user engagement with announcements that have visuals. This result holds for earnings tweets sent by the same firm and on the same day in firm-level and tweet-level analyses. Consistent with managerial opportunism, firms are more likely to use visuals in their earnings tweets when performance is good but less persistent. Consistent with visuals increasin g investor attention, the initial return response to earnings news is stronger and the post-announcement response is lower when visuals are used. Our evidence of a post-announcement return reversal indicates that visuals can be a double-edged sword. Furthermore, the higher earnings response coefficient from visuals is more pronounced on days with high investor distraction (when many other firms are also announcing earnings).

Therefore, a method to model the dynamics of collective user engagement is essential. This paper proposes a method to model the dynamics of collective user engagement in new product development using agent-based simulation. The model integrates an indirect engagement process – in which users exchange information and knowledge, draw from past experiences, and psychologically invest in the product – with a direct engagement process – in which users interact with the product and the firm to contribute. We demonstrate how the model can be calibrated using a consumer survey. Our findings reveal an overall increase in user engagement, characterised by nonlinear growth during the idea and design stages, followed by a relatively steady increase during the test stage. Moreover, our study identifies the significance of various factors, such as social network parameters, past experience, product connection, and match degree, in shaping user engagement in new product development. This research provides a systematic approach to model user engagement within the context of new product development. It also offers practical implications that can guide management decisions in effectively engaging with users during new product development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Beyond their immediate effects, digital badges can have enduring effects on UGC consumption and generation by affecting users’ underlying engagement states. To account for both effects, the authors develop a bivariate negative binomial hidden Markov model of content consumption and generation and estimate the model using a panel data set obtained from a large UGC platform. They find that users increase their content generation but decrease their content consumption immediately after being awarded a digital badge. Furthermore, being awarded a digital badge has a positive enduring effect on both content consumption and content generation behaviors of a user. This positive enduring effect mainly applies to users in relatively engaged states but not to users in the least engaged state.

We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that the dynamic policy generated by our framework improves the current practice in the industry by 5.76%. This improvement almost entirely comes from the increased average ad response to each impression instead of the increased usage by each user. We further document a U-shaped pattern in improvements across the length of the user’s history, with high values when the user is new or when enough data are available for the user. Next, we show that ad diversity is higher under our policy and explore the reason behind it.

In particular, since 2014, the news media have intensified their coverage of this emerging technology and its potential impact on most domains of society. Although many studies have analyzed traditional media coverage of AI, analyses of social media, especially video-sharing platforms, are rare. In addition, research from a risk communication perspective remains scarce, despite the widely recognized potential threats to society from many AI applications. This study aims to detect recurring patterns of societal threat/efficacy in YouTube videos, analyze their main sources, and compare detected frames in terms of reach and response. Using a theoretical framework combining framing and risk communication, the study analyzed the societal threat/efficacy attributed to AI in easily accessible YouTube videos published in a year when public attention to AI temporarily peaked (2018). Four dominant AI frames were identified: the balanced frame, the high-efficacy frame, the high-threat frame, and the no-threat frame. The balanced and no-threat frames were the most prevalent, with predominantly positive and neutral AI narratives that neither adequately address the risks nor the necessary societal response from a normative risk communication perspective. The results revealed the specific risks and benefits of AI that are most frequently addressed. Video views and user engagement with AI videos were analyzed. Recommendations for effective AI risk communication and implications for risk governance were derived from the results. © 2024 The Authors.

This paper examines the relationship between firm-generated content and user engagement on product pages and whether a page’s characteristics and content motivations moderate this relationship. Analyzing a sample of 29,267 posts on 85 Facebook product pages of 49 Fortune 1000 firms, we studied the relationship between the content (i.e., informational vs. emotional) and style (i.e., formal vs. informal) of a given post and the level of user engagement. The key finding is that in the content dimension, “incongruous” posts, i.e., content not traditionally expected for a product page of a given type, generate more favorable engagement. Also, informal style posts achieve more favorable engagement irrespective of the product page characteristics. The secondary discovery is attributable to Facebook’s function as a social media network where acquaintances engage with one another. The platform’s unwritten protocol of communication largely emphasizes informality, which is likely the driver of this observation.

The 353 responses obtained were analysed with SmartPLS, validating the structural equation modelling (SEM) through structural and measurement model verification. Findings: The authors' findings illustrate that descriptive norm, perceived behavioural control, as well as positive and negative anticipated emotion (NEM) and attitude, contribute positively to the desire to engage with OTT streaming services. Interestingly, the authors' study contradicts common assumptions, revealing that subjective norms do not significantly impact the propensity to utilise OTT services. This counterintuitive finding necessitates a reconsideration of prevalent theories and contributes to a nuanced understanding of OTT adoption determinants. Research limitations/implications: The data gathering for this study were conducted from the perspective of a single nation. Therefore, caution must be exercised when generalising this study's results. Practical implications: The practical ramifications of this research are vast, providing OTT service providers and marketers with actionable insights to maximise user engagement and navigate perceived risks related to OTT service adoption and consumption. Originality/value: This study's exploration of perceived risks and descriptive norms enhances the goal-directed behaviour model's breadth, facilitating a holistic comprehension of the constructs shaping OTT consumption behaviours.

These entities receive scores (e.g., through online reviews) in a variety of presentation formats: incremental (a raw score per episode; e.g., 5–5–2), cumulative (updated average scores; e.g., 5–5–4), or a combination thereof. This article focuses on prevalent situations in which a score deviates from prior scores and examines how the presentation format of the scores impacts decision makers’ (e.g., consumers, managers) evaluations of the entity scored. Across a wide variety of settings, nine experiments document that when a generally well-performing (poorly performing) entity suddenly receives a negative (positive) score, overall performance will be perceived as less negative (positive) when shown in a cumulative format compared with an incremental or combined format. This effect appears to be stronger when the deviating episode is more representative (e.g., due to higher recency or internal attribution). The authors also find evidence for their proposed explanation: a cumulative format distorts individuals’ perceptions of the underlying raw score of the deviating episode. These findings imply that presenting scores in alternative formats may affect marketing outcomes (e.g., customer churn, product choice, technology adoption, new product success, and user engagement on peer-to-peer platforms). © The Author(s) 2023."

A platform displays a list of products to a user in response to a search query. The user inspects the first k items in the list for a k chosen at random from a given distribution and decides whether to purchase an item from that set based on a choice model. The goal of the platform is to maximize the engagement of the shopper defined as the probability of purchase. This problem gives rise to a less-studied variation of submodular maximization, in which we are asked to choose an ordering of a set of elements to maximize a linear combination of different submodular functions. First, using a reduction to maximizing submodular functions over matroids, we give an optimal (1 - 1=e)-approximation for this problem. We then consider a variant in which the platform cares not only about user engagement, but also about diversification across various groups of users—that is, guaranteeing a certain probability of purchase in each group. We characterize the polytope of feasible solutions and give a bicriteria ((1 - 1=e)2, (1 - 1=e)2)-approximation for this problem by rounding an approximate solution of a linear-programming (LP) relaxation. For rounding, we rely on our reduction and the particular rounding techniques for matroid polytopes. For the special case in which underlying submodular functions are coverage functions—which is practically relevant in online retail—we propose an alternative LP relaxation and a simpler randomized rounding for the problem. This approach yields to an optimal bicriteria (1 - 1=e, 1 - 1=e)-approxima-tion algorithm for the special case of the problem with coverage functions. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS."

The focus of this paper is to identify factors that help to drive venue popularity revealed by location-based services, which then better facilitate companies’ operational decisions, such as procurement and staff scheduling. Using data collected from Foursquare and Yelp, we build, evaluate, and compare a wide variety of machine learning methods including deep learning models with varying characteristics and degrees of sophistication. First, we find that support vector regression is the best performing model compared to other complex predictive algorithms. Second, we apply SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution from each business feature at both the global and local levels. The global interpretability results show that customer loyalty, the agglomeration effect, and the word-of-mouth effect are the top three drivers of venue popularity. Furthermore, the local interpretability analysis reveals that the contributions of business features vary, both quantitatively and directionally. Our findings are robust with respect to different popularity measures, training and testing periods, and prediction horizons. These findings extend our knowledge of location-based services by demonstrating their potential to play a prominent role in attracting consumer engagement and boosting venue popularity. Managers can make better operational decisions such as procurement and staff scheduling based on these more accurate venue popularity prediction methods. Furthermore, this study also highlights the importance of model interpretability which enhances the ability of managers to more effectively utilize machine learning models for effective decision-making. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society."

The use of a mobile recycling application is evaluated with regard to its media richness with a sample of 12 539 users in Italy. The research is developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when users have become more environmentally conscious and aware of plastic pollution. This time period has also seen an increase in the use of mobile applications, which provide social engagement and other benefits. Although it has encouraged new research on recycling behavior and how environmental messages are spread, as far as we know, no research has included a specific technology, such as mobile applications. Through the lens of consumer social media engagement behavior, it has emerged that media richness has a positive correlation with user engagement and recycling behavior. Theoretically, the research offers a novel technological tool worthy of further exploration in the fields of management and engineering.

Most previous dialogue systems tried to achieve this goal by learning empathetic manners from anonymous conversational data. However, emotional responses generated by those methods may be inconsistent, which will decrease user engagement and service quality. Psychological findings suggest that the emotional expressions of humans are rooted in personality traits. Therefore, we propose a new task, Personality-affected Emotion Generation, to generate emotion based on the personality given to the dialogue system and further investigate a solution through the personality-affected mood transition. Specifically, we first construct a daily dialogue dataset, Personality EmotionLines Dataset (PELD), with emotion and personality annotations. Subsequently, we analyze the challenges in this task, i.e., (1) heterogeneously integrating personality and emotional factors and (2) extracting multi-granularity emotional information in the dialogue context. Finally, we propose to model the personality as the transition weight by simulating the mood transition process in the dialogue system and solve the challenges above. We conduct extensive experiments on PELD for evaluation. Results suggest that by adopting our method, the emotion generation performance is improved by 13% in macro-F1 and 5% in weighted-F1 from the BERT-base model.

This study investigates whether similar inequities exist within the context of mobile apps specifically designed to provide self-support and peer-support. To this end, we conduct an empirical analysis using longitudinal user-level data collected from a mental health mobile app (MHMA). Our results indicate that: (i) in contrast to the traditional clinic-based mental health services, in a MHMA setting, users from the underserved population engage with the app services and derive similar benefits as much as their better-served counterparts; and (ii) there is a positive relationship between app usage frequency and the mental condition of app users. Our post-hoc analysis uncovers that the MHMA promotes equitable usage and benefit for users: (i) from the underserved population via self-management functions that enable self-support; and (ii) from the better-served population via online community functions that facilitate peer-support. These findings suggest that MHMAs have the potential to achieve equity through both user engagement and the benefits derived from such engagement.

The increasing importance of digital technology (DT) in palliative care delivery presents both opportunities and challenges. Objective: This study aimed to explore the perspectives and preferences of palliative care patients and their family caregivers regarding the use of DT in care delivery. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with palliative care patients and their family caregivers across various settings. Participants were selected through gatekeeper-supported purposive sampling. Interviews were analysed using structured qualitative content analysis. Results: Nineteen interviews were conducted.Three themes emerged: (1) Application of DTs in palliative care; (2) Potential of DTs; (3) Barriers to the use of DTs. Key findings highlighted the preference for real-time communication using DTs that participants are familiar with. Participants reported limited perceived value for digital transformation in the presence of in-person care. The study identified requirements for DT development and use in palliative care, including the need for direct and immediate functionality, efficiency in healthcare professional (HCP) work, and continuous access to services. Conclusion: The findings highlight a demonstrate the importance of familiarity with DTs and real-time access for patients and their families. While DT can enhance palliative care efficiency and accessibility, its integration must complement, not replace, in-person interaction in palliative care. As DTs continue to grow in scope and use in palliative care, maintaining continued user engagement is essential to optimise their adoption and ensure they benefit patients and their caregivers. © The Author(s) 2024."

We leverage a natural experiment on Zhihu, a Q&A platform that offers a social-interaction-oriented functionality called Ideas. Zhihu initially presented answers (expert knowledge content) and ideas (social posts) in two different information feeds, but the platform integrated ideas into the same information feed as answers in June 2019. We find that information feed integration significantly decreased user engagement with and contribution of both ideas and answers. We hypothesize that users decreased their engagement because the juxtaposition of incongruous types of content increased mindset switching and cognitive strain. This hypothesis is supported by an additional laboratory experiment.

Content providers have changed from providing merely content to offering social content experiences that allow users not only to passively consume content but also to actively participate. As the latest development, social live streaming services (SLSS) have emerged that enable so-called co-interactive behaviour, i.e., the live interplay between users while co-experiencing content. Yet, it remains unclear how co-interactive behaviour affects the monetisation of social live content. Based on a data set of 868,940 users from 59 gaming channels of the freemium-based SLSS Twitch, we empirically show that co-interactive behaviour has a stronger effect on users’ willingness to subscribe (WTS) than passive and active behaviour. Since we find that a user’s reciprocated interactions also directly increase other users’ WTS, our results call for dismantling the current dichotomy of user participation and social influences in IS research. We suggest a social-experiential perspective that integrates social influences as an inherent part of users’ participation experiences. This novel interactive second-person perspective contributes to research on user engagement and value capture on social content platforms, and it allows SLSS providers to obtain a more precise picture of user value to better develop or adapt their monetisation strategies. © The Operational Research Society 2022."

Despite extensive researches on the interactivity of mobile short video app, there has been a limited focus on understanding the underlying factors that contribute to users' perceived benefits and continuance intention. Leveraging insights from preceding studies, this study develops a conceptual research model that investigates how two distinct facets of interactivity, namely social interactivity and system interactivity, influence users' perceived benefits from mobile short video apps, ultimately impacting their intention to continue using them. This analysis rigorously scrutinizes data garnered from 808 users of mobile short video applications, employing structural equation modeling to validate the proposed hypotheses. The findings conclusively reveal that interactivity significantly affects users’ perceived benefits from mobile short video apps. Moreover, the study elucidates that perceived benefits from these apps are the significant predictors of continuance intention. Furthermore, interactivity could indirectly influence continuance intention via the mediation of perceived benefits. These findings possess the potential not only to augment our comprehension of perceived benefits and continuance intention from the interactivity perspective but also to furnish valuable insights for scholars in the field.

In this paper, we use a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of crowdsourcing on enhancing user engagement and retention in the context of mobile gaming apps. We examine two specific crowdsourcing features: the ability to submit content and the ability to access crowdsourced content. We find that the content submission significantly increases engagement and retention by reducing users’ hazard of ending a session by approximately 11% relative to the baseline and reducing the hazard of abandoning the game app by 14%. In contrast, giving users the ability to access crowdsourced content has no significant effect on engagement but has a positive effect on retention by reducing the hazard of abandoning the game app by 13%. Surprisingly, we find that the interaction effect of these two crowdsourced features is negative on user engagement. Individually, the submission feature manifests itself via empowering users to control their product use experience, whereas the access feature’s positive effect on retention is mediated by diversity and novelty of content. However, the two effects are not complementary. It turns out when these two features are given together, the empowerment enabled by one’s own submission is crowded out by others’ submissions, and this dominates the diversity benefit. Crowdsourcing features have heterogeneous impact on different user segments, with heavy users and users of longer tenure being more affected by the crowdsourcing features. © 2021 The Author(s)"

Analysis of implicit interaction data and explicit user feedback demonstrates that high-quality CQs improve user performance and satisfaction. By contrast, low-And mid-quality CQs are harmful, and thus allowing the users to complete their tasks without CQ support may be preferred in this case. We also observe that user engagement, and therefore the need for CQ support, is affected by several factors, such as search result quality or perceived task difficulty.

Instead, token prices have a mediating role in the relationship between total rewards earned by content creators and the volume of UGC they produce. Furthermore, we observe that an increase in UGC does not lead to a corresponding rise in the platform's market capitalization, as increased website traffic intensifies competition for rewards from a constant pool, suggesting that heightened user engagement does not translate to enhanced market capitalization.

The cognitive outcome is measured using the increase in the level of Sharia financial literacy, while the noncognitive outcome is measured using the behavioral intention to use VR-BS. Design/methodology/approach: The method consists of two parts: First, the development of VR-BS, in the context of sharia financial literacy, using the waterfall model. Second, testing the effectiveness of VR-BS using the theory of interactive media effects framework. The participants were 142 students from three secondary schools (two Islamic religious schools and one public school) in Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used for testing the hypotheses. Findings: VR-BS creates a perceived coolness and vividness, which in turn has an impact on increasing the participants’ engagement. Also, the use of VR has an impact on natural mapping, which increases a user’s engagement through its perceived ease of use. As predicted, the user’s engagement affects VR’s behavior, mediated by the user’s attitude toward VR media. VR’s interactivity, however, does not impact on the cognitive aspect. Research limitations/implications: The participants were not randomly selected, as the data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the majority of the participants had never tried VR before this study. The participants, however, were digital natives. Practical implications: It is implied from the findings that Islamic financial business actors and the relevant government agencies (e.g. the Indonesian Financial Services Authority [OJK], the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology and the Ministry of Religious Affairs) should collaborate to best prepare the future generation of ummah by using VR-BS in their joint promotion and education programs. The results of the current study reveal that the use of VR-BS may attract people to engage in Islamic financial activities. By engaging in such activities, or at least engaging in real-life simulations/classes/workshops, people may gradually acquire more knowledge about Islamic finance. Originality/value: As predicted, the user’s engagement has an impact on behavior toward VR-BS, which is mediated by attitude toward VR-BS. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

A strong super-application has gained popularity and sustained customer demand due to Indonesia's smartphone industry expansion. To achieve this objective, a quantitative-qualitative approach utilizing Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) and interviews was employed. Ten-fold indicators determined the sample size, while convenience sampling gathered 392 respondents. The software for data analysis is SmartPLS 4.1.0.0. The results indicate the acceptance of eight hypotheses and the rejection of the remaining two. Playfulness is positively affecting attitudes and loyalty program usage. Next, affective commitment positively affects attitude and loyalty program usage. Next, reward attractiveness positively affects attitude. Finally, the relationship between attitude, usage, satisfaction, and loyalty is significant. The determinant factors of brand loyalty were playfulness, reward attractiveness, and affective commitment. The theoretical contribution is that the impact of loyalty programs on brand loyalty reveals that factors like playfulness and affective commitment influence attitudes and usage, despite gamification's potential moderating effect. The practical implication is that Gojek should improve its loyalty program strategy by diversifying the range of rewards and integrating gamification, particularly in-app games, to maintain user engagement and brand loyalty. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

The questionnaires were distributed to postgraduate students enrolled in Jordanian universities with digital libraries, who were recruited via purposive sampling. A total of 261 responses were received, with 67 deemed unsuitable for the study analysis and subsequently excluded. Resultantly, 194 valid questionnaires were finalized for data analysis. The SMART-partial least squares (PLS) software was utilized to conduct structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the study hypotheses. This study discovered that the variables, namely performance expectancy, effort, and facilitating conditions expectancy, were significantly and positively associated with the outcome variable, which is the intention to employ digital libraries. Meanwhile, social influence was revealed to be insignificant. Performance expectancy also significantly mediated the correlations between technological readiness and the intention to utilize and between online self-efficacy and the intention to utilize. The present study focused only on potential users among postgraduate students at Jordanian universities with digital libraries. The findings contributed valuable insights into the academic sector, especially library management to enhance the rate of digital library or e-library adoption at Jordanian universities. Digital library managers and policymakers could leverage the findings to design pertinent strategies that increase user engagement within digital library environments.

Covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to analyse data collected from users of a GSN (i.e., Facebook) in the United Kingdom (UK) and India. The results indicate that PBG significantly influences both active and passive user engagement. This relationship is mediated by users' identification with a GSN brand and community. Additionally, the findings indicate that the associations between PBG and user engagement (active/passive) on GSN vary as a function of users' global identity. The results also demonstrate some country-specific variations in key relationships.

Our method allows us to simultaneously capture three interdependent usage behaviors using a single integrated model and identify the impact of content loading time and previous reading behavior on users’ engagement dynamics and content consumption. We calibrate the model using a tap stream data set of individual users’ reading activities on a mobile app. Our analysis reveals three distinct engagement states, a low state with inactive users, a medium state with users sampling books, and a high state with users reading intensively. Furthermore, we find that content loading time has higher negative impacts on high-state users in state transitioning than medium-state users. In contrast, the days that elapsed since the last visit has a similar negative impact on the users in the high and medium states. The effect of usage frequency on users in state transitioning is always positive. We have also identified the weekend effect and social influence on users’ reading outcomes.

Several factors at the content-level turned out to vary across platforms, thereby pointing to the need for HEIs to tailor their social media communication to the respective affordances of different platforms. However, results also show patterns across platforms, including the importance of visual communication and the development of a large followership for driving user engagement.

However, evidence is limited on when and why image characteristics can draw social media users’ attention and increase engagement. In this research, the authors theorize that color complexity in images can serve as an external cue that draws social media users’ attention and provokes a shift from the peripheral processing mode to the central processing mode. This shift can result in deeper processing of the social media post that features the image, thus increasing the likelihood of the users’ engagement with the post. They further reveal heterogeneity in the effect of color complexity due to the time of day when the users are exposed to the image, image height, and sentiment and complexity in the text accompanying the image. The results are consistent across an empirical analysis of two proprietary Facebook datasets from distinct industries and time periods and confirmed by two biometric eye-tracking experiments that provide process evidence.

Satiation lowers users’ CLV to an extent that renders acquisition from the likes of Facebook and Google untenable, driving game publishers to cross-promote, that is, sell and swap users among themselves. We model this cross-promotion as first, a screening mechanism, in that the fact of playing a game indicates specific preferences that might be suitable to an exchange with similar games; and second, as a resetting mechanism that enables the swapped users to reset their engagement in the new game, thus rendering the swap or sell beneficial to both buyer and seller. We show that there exists an optimal level of satiation with a game, and with this level, we show the conditions under which the game publisher cross promotes, and when it does, what the conditions are for selling rather than swapping.

Monetization is often used to induce user content generation. However, research documents that while monetization increases the quantity of specific kinds of content, it does not necessarily increase the total content quantity or user engagement (i.e., platform value). Furthermore, the impact of monetization may depend on the social status of content creators. This article investigates paid question and answer (paid Q&A). Based on expectancy theory and relevant research, this article hypothesizes the effects of introducing paid Q&A on both total content quantity and user engagement and on answerers of differing statuses. We test the model using data from a natural quasi-experiment of the introduction of paid Q&A to Weibo. The key insight of our study is that total platform value in terms of both total content quantity and user engagement rises with the presence of paid Q&A. Furthermore, we find that an answerer's status negatively moderates the impact of introducing the paid Q&A feature on total content quantity but positively moderates its impact on user engagement. Our research provides insights into the causality of introducing the paid Q&A feature on platform value as well as the boundary condition of this relationship. Practically, paid Q&A is shown to be profitable to social media platforms and to increase the benefits to platform users.  © 1988-2012 IEEE."

In this article, we examine how discrete emotion synchronicity, which refers to the synchronicity between MTM discrete emotions in the video content and MTM viewer emotional reactions, is associated with user engagement on video-based social media. Using a set of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and a regression model, we first extract discrete emotion synchronicity from videos with multimodal data streams. Then, we conduct an empirical analysis to determine the impact of discrete emotion synchronicity on user engagement. Our results indicate that discrete emotion synchronicity does not always lead to higher user engagement on video-based social media. First, discrete emotion synchronicity that increases the number of video tips (i.e., joy) cannot increase the number of saves and shares. Second, discrete emotion synchronicity (i.e., calm, solemnity, and sadness) has a negative effect on 3 types of engagement behaviors in some cases. Third, the negative effect of discrete emotion synchronicity outweighs its positive effect. Our work offers new insight into how discrete emotions facilitate or hinder user engagement in the context of video-based social media and has practical implications for firms’ marketing strategies on video-oriented social media. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The most popular YouTuber can attract up to 100 million followers. Since there are multiple popular platforms, it's quite common that a YouTuber publishes the same media to multiple platforms, or replicates all media from one platform to another. However, the users of different platforms have different tastes. The media that is popular on one platform may not be a great vogue on other platforms. Observing such cross-platform variance, we propose a new task: estimating the user engagement score of a media on one platform given its popularity on other platforms. This task can benefit both the YouTubers and the platform. On one hand, YouTubers can use the predicted engagement to guide the media reworking; on the other hand, the platform can use the predicted engagement to establish promotion and advertising plans. Therefore, this task is of great practical value. To tackle this task, we propose a disentangled neural network that can separate the general media adorability from platform inclinations. In this manner, by substituting the inclination from the source platform to the target platform, we are able to predict the user engagement in the target platform. To validate the proposed model, we manage to build a dataset of micro-videos which are published on four platforms TikTok, Kwai, Bilibili, and WESEE.

To test its hypotheses, the study estimates a fixed-effects regression model on a panel dataset of content creators collected using a web-scraping method. The findings indicate that as the frequency of creators' content sharing increases, user engagement behavior initially increases but then falls after reaching a peak, supporting the inverted U-shaped relationship.

This paper analyzes how to build user engagement from a learning perspective, strengthening the effort to learn about personal healthcare. Specifically, we investigate how the determinants of MHAs' functional value (technology effort, technology performance, and brand trust) drive the user's hedonic (enjoyment) and social (networking, social image) value. Data is obtained from a sample of 400 current users of MHAs. Our findings show that technology performance mainly enhances the user's networking experience, while technology effort contributes mostly to enjoyment and brand trust is critical to the user's social image. The user's hedonic and social experience benefit user engagement, which ultimately fosters user loyalty and advocacy, thus bolstering the relevance of developing user-centric MHAs.

This may optimize the uptake of evidence in healthcare practice, resulting in improved health outcomes or more efficient healthcare systems. However, barriers to involving knowledge users in the research process exist. Theories, models and frameworks may help guide the process of involving knowledge users and address barriers to engaging with knowledge users in research; however, there is little evidence identifying or describing the theories, models and frameworks of health research partnerships. Objectives: Identify and describe theories, models and frameworks of health research partnerships. Report on concepts of knowledge user engagement represented in identified theories, models and frameworks. Methods: We conducted a scoping review. Database (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PCORI) and ancestry and snowball searches were utilized. Included articles were written in English, published between January 2005 and June 2021, specific to health, a research partnership, and referred to a theory, model or framework. No critical appraisal was conducted. We developed a coding framework to extract details related to the publication (e.g. country, year) and theory, model or framework (e.g. intended users, theoretical underpinning, methodology, methods of development, purpose, concepts of knowledge user engagement). One reviewer conducted data extraction. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were utilized to report the results. Results: We identified 21 874 articles in screening. Thirty-nine models or frameworks were included in data analysis, but no theory. Two models or frameworks (5%) were underpinned by theory. Literature review was the method (n = 11, 28%) most frequently used to develop a model or framework. Guiding or managing a partnership was the most frequently reported purpose of the model/framework (n = 14, 36%). The most represented concept of knowledge user engagement was principles/values (n = 36, 92%). Conclusions: The models and frameworks identified could be utilized by researchers and knowledge users to inform aspects of a health research partnership, such as guidance or implementation of a partnership. Future research evaluating the quality and applicability of the models and frameworks is necessary to help partners decide which model or framework to implement. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Using a controlled laboratory environment, exogenously imposed variation in content quality and user preferences allows for the construction of a structural model over user search, inference, selection and engagement in the presence of a given rating mechanism. The results of this study suggest that increasing the granularity of the signals available to users increases their ability to make inferences into the quality of content, which causes improvements in user welfare. The experimental data directly revealed that a five-point likert scale rating mechanism improved user welfare by 10.8% over a single ‘like’ button, and counterfactual analysis from the structural model indirectly revealed it improved welfare by 16.2% over providing no rating mechanism at all. User engagement also increased with the granularity of the rating mechanism, which further aided in the reduction of the asymmetric information. © 2022"

We collected data from users of the DianTao App. The results show that social bonds and structural bonds positively affect user engagement, while financial bonds have no direct impact on user engagement. Financial bonds, social bonds, and structural bonds are positively related to trust in the broadcaster. Similarly, financial bonds, social bonds, and structural bonds are also positively associated with trust in the platform. Furthermore, trust in the broadcaster and trust in the platform directly affects user engagement, fully mediating the impact of financial bonds on user engagement, while partially mediating the impacts of social bonds and structural bonds on user engagement.

But how much value do users derive from their seemingly free apps (zero-price services), and what user costs are associated with this value exchange? By adopting a human-centric lens, this article scrutinizes the complex trade-offs users face trying to capture the benefits and unperceived costs that such usage entails. Design/methodology/approach: Using a mixed-method research design, this study is anchored in empirical survey data from 196 participants in Linköping, Sweden. The authors investigate users’ willingness to pay for these services in relation to different types of costs. Findings: The results indicate that users can derive significant value from the use of free services, which can be interpreted as a win-win situation between users and companies. Regarding costs, this research shows that the most significant costs for users are associated with procrastination, sleep deprivation and reduced focus, which can be challenging to identify and evaluate from the users’ perspective. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that zero-price services provide significant benefits like enhancing social connectivity and offering a wide variety of content. Significant drawbacks, such as increased procrastination and sleep disturbances, highlight the psychological effects of these platforms. These impacts include behavioral changes, emphasizing the influence of online platforms on user engagement. Furthermore, a trend toward single-purchase preferences over free services suggests changing consumer attitudes toward digital payment models. This underscores the need for further research on non-monetary aspects in zero-price markets for better understanding and regulation of the digital economy. Practical implications: This study shows that users appreciate the accessibility and potential of zero-price services but are wary of privacy concerns. It underscores the need for companies to balance profit objectives with user experiences and privacy requirements. Offering a range of ad-free premium services to meet diverse customer needs can be effective. Users’ high valuation of privacy and transparency suggests businesses should focus on human-centric, privacy-respecting strategies. Increased transparency in data usage and giving users greater data control could enhance the user experience and foster sustainable customer relationships. Social implications: The study calls for policymakers to focus on non-monetary risks of zero-price services, such as behavioral changes and digital well-being impacts. They should consider implementing regulations to protect users, especially children, from manipulative designs such as “dark patterns”. Policymakers must balance user protection with innovation, leading to a sustainable zero-price economy. For zero-price service users, awareness of non-monetary costs, like procrastination and sleep deprivation, is vital. Understanding that “free” services have hidden costs is important, especially for younger generations. Managing privacy settings and selective service choices can protect privacy and well-being. Originality/value: This research shifts the focus from simply valuing personal data based on market prices to assessing the worth of free services themselves. By listing various hidden costs, it underscores the need for increased user awareness and greater corporate transparency. Uniquely, it finds that users prefer making one-time purchases over using zero-price services, extending prior assumptions in the field. Additionally, it also characterizes the zero-price economy ecosystem, highlighting differences between market types and provides a deeper understanding of the zero-price market and its related concepts. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, the existing knowledge on this empirical subject has two significant shortcomings. First, while the narrative about project value suffices to explain how a project enacts value for its stakeholders, it falls short of unfolding the enacted value of a complex project for its end-users from a broader economic and societal perspective. Second, while literature effectively explains project stakeholder engagement practices, the role played by other elements of a complex project' ecology in shaping the engagement practices with end-users remains largely underexplored. This paper aims to explain how organizations in complex projects' ecologies engage with their end-users to enact the value of complex projects. Leveraging a qualitative and inductive approach, we conducted 31 open interviews with managers of organizations in the European space project ecology, and their end-users. Drawing on a grounded theory approach, we identified four classes of engagement practices.

(2) ""Personal for value expected,""adopted by space managers to be engaged by end-user managers and understand their value expectation.

(4) ""Nonpersonal""engagement practices, adopted by organizations in the complex project ecology toward their end-users. We contribute to the literature on value and engagement by showing that: (1) value enactment occurs through personal engagement and is not only impersonal; (2) form of value (i.e., espoused, expected, and enacted) shapes the engagement of managers and organizations in the complex project ecologies toward their end-users; and (3) a project ecology perspective enhances the understanding of the value of complex projects for end-users. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Governments and businesses play important roles in fostering public acceptance of eco-friendly products and in increasing people's use of resource recycling to achieve sustainable development. The present study, thus, explores how a website's gamification mechanics influence the intrinsic motivations and needs satisfaction of users as well as their engagement in resource recycling. In addition, it investigates how environmental concerns moderate the relationships between intrinsic motivations and user engagement. The results reveal that gamification helps foster user engagement in resource recycling by influencing needs satisfaction (i.e., relatedness, competence, and autonomy) between gamification mechanics and intrinsic motivations (i.e., self-presentation, self-efficacy, and flow). For users with high vs. low environmental concerns, intrinsic motivations have a more significant effect on their engagement in resource recycling. It is found that gamification not only creates intrinsic motivation, but it is also likely to facilitate the satisfaction of psychological needs through mechanisms such as self-expression, point rewards, and competition. This research adds to the literature by contributing a slightly different understanding of the success of gamification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

Furthermore, the serial mediation effect of SA and SIC on CE shows that attractive sources are likely to induce higher SIC and subsequent CE. Practical implications: The results reveal that without a pleasing SA and positive SIC, mobile users skip the ads by perceiving them to be irritating or interruptive. Mobile ads might cost relatively less, but the advertisers should understand the significance of the SA toward minimizing the mobile advertising skepticism. Originality/value: Advertisers can enhance the user’s engagement on mobile devices by addressing both the SA and SIC in their VC. The combined effect of both the SA and SIC on CE has not been assessed before. Furthermore, this study has used the SOR mechanism to examine CE. © 2023, Muhammad Talha, Zonaib Tahir and Iqra Mehroush."

However, relatively little research has explored the potential contributions of the accounting profession to resilience at multiple scales and levels of analysis. To address the need for additional research, in this study we explore the contributions of the accounting profession to resilience during COVID-19. Drawing on a unique database of over 26,000 social media posts by the two principal professional accounting bodies in the UK context (ICAEW, ACCA) and UK-based accounts of the ‘Big 4’ professional services firms (PwC, Deloitte, EY, and KPMG), as well as user-engagement with those posts, we highlight processes by which the accounting profession encouraged resilience among individuals, organisations, and wider society. Our findings illuminate how the accounting profession contributed to resilience by supporting more effective crisis responses (by sharing trusted advice and shaping policy responses), better crisis adaptation (by crafting post-crisis futures and empowering the profession), and improved future crisis anticipation (by challenging complacency and being good citizens). We build on our analysis to propose a new framework characterising pathways for professions contributing to resilience. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing user engagement in IBTDM is lacking due to limited empirical evidence from real-world applications. This study bridges this research gap by examining data from over 4,000 users in an actual IBTDM program, incenTrip, in the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore region. Employing Poisson-Tweedie generalized additive models to account for excess zeros and nonlinear relations, the study examines how home and work-related factors influence users’ enrollment and engagement, measured by the number of registrations, generated trips, and earned incentives at a census block group level. Results reveal that: 1) Urban areas with high population densities and low incomes attract more users and encourage more green travel. 2) Initial enrollment is higher among young, female, Asian, and highly-educated residents, although their subsequent engagement may not be sustained. 3) Workers in educational institutions and retail trades exhibit higher enrollment and maintain stronger engagement than other workers. 4) Well-developed transportation facilities and a higher density of points of interest near the users’ homes or workplaces substantially enhance program attractiveness. 5) Nonlinearities, particularly threshold effects, are observed across various relations analyzed. These findings have valuable policy implications for optimizing ongoing IBTDM programs and informing future initiatives. Policy recommendations include implementing targeted and progressive incentives, adopting combined TDM strategies, prioritizing user-friendly designs, fostering collaboration with employers, and employing nuanced policymaking. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, monitoring data are not available to many potential users and the disparate nature of water bodies makes consistent monitoring across so many systems difficult. While satellite Earth observation (EO) offers solutions, there are numerous challenges that limit the use of satellite EO for water monitoring. To understand the perceptions of using satellite EO for water quality monitoring, a survey was conducted within academia and the water quality management sector. Study objectives were to assess community understanding of satellite EO water quality data, identify barriers in the adoption of satellite EO data, and analyse trust in satellite EO data. Most (40 %) participants were beginners with little understanding of satellite EO. Participants indicated problems with satellite EO data accessibility (31 %) and interpretability (26 %). Results showed a high level of trust with satellite EO data and higher trust with in-situ EO data. This study highlighted the gap between water science, applied social science, and policy.

Given the importance of doctor engagement, some online health communities have introduced informal payments to doctors to encourage knowledge sharing. This study empirically examines how informal payments in the form of monetary gifts affect doctor engagement. We leverage the launch of a gifting feature by a leading online health community as a natural experiment that exogenously provides doctors with extra monetary incentives. By adopting multiple strategies to strengthen the causal identification, we find that the introduction of the gifting feature negatively affects doctors’ responses to medical consultations. Our results indicate a crowding-out effect of informal payments on doctors’ intrinsic motivation to engage in such consultations. Interestingly, our consultation-level analysis suggests that monetary and nonmonetary gifts play distinct roles in motivating doctor responses, with nonmonetary gifts having a more significant carryover effect on follow-up interactions and better promoting the doctor-patient relationship. We also find that social status moderates the impact of digital gifting on online engagement. Our study has important implications for research and practice. In addition to contributing to the literature on informal payments, our results provide useful implications for online health communities that have implemented or are planning to implement digital gifting to stimulate user engagement.

Yet, evidence on its benefits is limited, and IT managers are left without a clear guidance on why to implement it. To solve the problem, this article shows the benefits of gamification for overall job performance and the intermediating mechanisms through which it exercises its advantageous effects. It is theorized that employees’ engagement in gamification favorably alters their cognitions, transferring their effect onto employee attitudes and behaviors in the workplace. First, user engagement in gamification alters cognitions about the performance management system, making employees perceive justice, which, in turn, affects their satisfaction with the performance system. Second, user engagement in gamification alters cognitions about the job, influencing the perceptions of job stressors that affect job satisfaction. Third, user engagement in gamification alters cognitions about the organization, making employees perceive organizational support, which translates into higher organizational commitment. The improved cognitions then transfer their beneficial effect onto overall job performance as justice is found to exercise a mediating effect. The findings from 268 employees in a human resource service organization support the hypotheses and provide concrete evidence for the benefits of gamification in performance management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

We estimate the model using data from two social network games with considerable overlap among network members. We find that friends who are only multiplex across games exert greater peer influence on users’ game visits than members who are embedded within a single game. We also determined that ignoring network multiplexity across games may lead firms to mistarget users due to biased peer influences of embedded friends.

Social media has played a major role in generation and dissemination of information about the pandemic. This information on the social media has been posted by a wide range of individuals and organizations including government agencies, health organizations or professionals, news organizations or reporters, for profit and nonprofit organizations, and political, religious, corporate, or community leaders. Irrespective of the content or modality, the main objective of people/organizations posting information on social media is to spread their message to as many people as possible. The objective of this research is to examine the factors that contribute to user engagement with video content posted on YouTube on COVID-19 related topics. As such, the influence of YouTube videos about COVID-19 is examined within the context of narrative persuasion as compared with argument-based persuasion. This research is based on a unique approach to first analyze the content of YouTube videos in terms of having argument-based persuasive elements versus having narrative-based persuasive elements using text analysis. Content of videos is then related to user engagement metrics to assess which type of content (argument-based versus narrative-based) can generate greater user engagement. Data for the study were collected from YouTube videos about COVID-19 (N=831). Content of selected videos was extracted in the form of transcripts of posted videos and analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 (LIWC2015) (Pennebaker et al., 2015a; Pennebaker et al., 2015b). Measures of argument-based content of videos (analytical thinking and clout) and narrative-based (authentic and emotional tone) were based on variables reported by LIWC2015. YouTube engagement metrics reflect how viewers interact with posted videos. Of the four publicly available engagement metrics three were used (number of likes, number of dislikes, and number of comments) as dependent variables. Overall, results indicate that narrative-based content in YouTube videos related to COVID-19 have stronger relationship with viewer engagement compared with argument-based content on the same platform. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

However, chaotic sources and homogenized content have led to poor user experiences. Taking Kulangsu and Xi'an City Wall in China as examples, this study explored the influence of matching short-form video sources with destination types on user engagement and visit intention. Design/methodology/approach: This study selected three short-form videos from different sources for each destination on TikTok and conducted an empirical research using a 3 × 2 experimental design to examine the proposed research model. Findings: The results showed that the matching effect between short-form video sources and destination types will positively affect user engagement and visit intention. (1) the short-form videos with user-generated content (UGC) or professional user-generated content (PUGC) in hedonic destinations can obtain higher user engagement and visit intention; (2) the short-form videos with professionally generated content (PGC) or PUGC in utilitarian destinations can obtain higher user engagement and visit intention and (3) perceived credibility and perceived usefulness played mediating roles in these interactions. Originality/value: This study considers short-form video sources as antecedent variables influencing user engagement and visit intention and confirms the matching effect between short-form video sources and tourism destination types. The findings will help researchers and marketers better understand the impact of short-form video on destination marketing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

As recommender systems evolve, increasingly sophisticated learning techniques are applied and have achieved better performance in terms of user engagement metrics such as clicks and browsing time. The increase in the measured performance, however, can have two possible attributions: a better understanding of user preferences, and a more proactive ability to utilize human bounded rationality to seduce user over-consumption. A natural following question is whether current recommendation algorithms are manipulating user preferences. If so, can we measure the manipulation level? In this article, we present a general framework for benchmarking the degree of manipulations of recommendation algorithms, in both slate recommendation and sequential recommendation scenarios. The framework consists of four stages, initial preference calculation, training data collection, algorithm training and interaction, and metrics calculation that involves two proposed metrics, Manipulation Score and Preference Shift. We benchmark some representative recommendation algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets under the proposed framework. We have observed that a high online click-through rate does not necessarily mean a better understanding of user initial preference, but ends in prompting users to choose more documents they initially did not favor. Moreover, we find that the training data have notable impacts on the manipulation degrees, and algorithms with more powerful modeling abilities are more sensitive to such impacts. The experiments also verified the usefulness of the proposed metrics for measuring the degree of manipulations. We advocate that future recommendation algorithm studies should be treated as an optimization problem with constrained user preference manipulations.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This research links these two important concepts and tests the influence of interactivity (two-way communication, participation, and joint problem-solving) on customer engagement. The findings from two surveys with customers of 10 leading SEPs (total N = 1,654) indicate that two-way communication and participation, two key dimensions of interactivity, enhance engagement while joint problem-solving remains non-consequential.

These platforms are also dynamic, with shows or discussions changing quickly inside a room and users frequently switching between rooms. To improve user engagement and experience on such platforms, we design a new recommendation model named Dynamic Representations for Live Streaming Rooms (DRIVER) to provide room recommendations. Guided by the Integrated Framework for Consumer Path Modeling and the social affordance theory, DRIVER infers dynamic representations of live streaming rooms by leveraging users’ behavior paths in entering, staying in, and leaving rooms. One contribution of our model is a new and efficient dynamic learning framework to model instantaneous and ever-changing inter-room relationships by considering individual users’ behavior paths after leaving a room. Also supported by social affordance theory, another methodological novelty of our model is to capture dynamic characteristics of a room by incorporating features of the current audience inside the room. Experiments on real-world datasets from two different types of live streaming platforms demonstrate that DRIVER outperforms state-of-the-art representation learning methods and sequential recommender systems. The proposed method also has implications for recommender system design in other contexts, in which items are characterized by users’ dynamic behavior paths and ongoing social interactions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

Using the panel vector autoregression and regression discontinuity in time framework, we analyze two distinct data sets from Steemit, the largest and most popular BOSM, to study the impact of bot engagement on human users and the impact of changes in financial reward on user engagement. Interestingly, our findings demonstrate that while increased engagement by bots is positively associated with engagement by human users, the association between bot engagement and human user engagement decreases as the number of votes for a post increases.

Despite the value of the database for improving prescribing and medicine use, its use remains suboptimal. This study aimed to develop a training program for five medicine-focused organisations in Canada and Australia to facilitate the use and understanding of the Rx for Change database. Methods: Four steps were undertaken: 1) key informant interviews were completed across all organisations to understand the knowledge user perspective; 2) a directed content analysis was completed of the interview transcripts and proposed training was developed; 3) a second round of feedback on the proposed training by knowledge users was gathered; and 4) feedback was integrated to develop the final training. Results: Sixteen key informant interviews with knowledge users were conducted. Themes for training content included the scope of, navigation and strategies for using Rx for Change (generic content) and practical examples on incorporating evidence within their workplace context (tailored content). The final training consisted of an informational video, a 60-minute face-to-face workshop and two post-training reminders. Conclusions: A method of engaging knowledge users in the development of a training program to improve the use of an on-line database of systematic reviews was established and used to design training.

Although the growth in the number of participants in an infomediary is expected to add value by increasing the diversity of information that is potentially exchanged, the infomediary cannot survive without the sustained engagement of existing users. The challenge is to understand the underlying processes at the operational workflow level of an infomediary that can lead to sustained engagement of patients. For an infomediary to increase engagement, it needs to know not only what motivates participants to join an infomediary but also what keeps them engaged in various stages of participation or transitions. In this study, we employ a Markov Chain modeling approach, along with an analysis of the user activities data, to understand the underlying mechanism of patient engagement along with several transition states in an online health infomediary. We tracked 127,610 members, with more than 1 million activities involved in an online health infomediary that supports cosmetic and reconstructive surgery patients over one year. Patients’ decisions for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery are health and well-being choices that rely not only on patients’ current situation but also on the knowledge and experience of others.

In response, the IASB has, over more than a decade, sought to increase user centricity, adapting its people and processes to more fully engage the views of users. We report on our empirical analysis from the standard setter's perspective of user engagement which is a research objective not documented in the prior literature. Our results draw on interviews conducted with 31 IASB representatives, comprised of 26 staff and 5 Board members representing approximately 60% of IASB's non-support staff as well as publically available archival data. We deploy the Griffiths (1960) citizenship participation framework in reporting on the procedural rigor directed at user utility, to assess IASB's attempt to enhance its perceived relevance (existential enhancement) as a standard setting body. We explain how a “clash” between new user centric practices and the extant practices led to challenges for the IASB in factoring the views of, and acting in the interest of users, as demanded by regulatory authorities. We discuss some of the tensions this has made evident in IASB's objective to function as an effective standard setter. Conceptually, our paper clarifies how more embedded representation modes per Griffith (1960) elicited greater user feedback, but that tensions arose in relation to the IASB's broader objectives to more directly serve users’ interests. Functionally, we offer a more nuanced appreciation for why the IASB might not unilaterally seek to be “user-focused” in the interests of both users and other stakeholders, and in doing so, serve the longer term objectives of accounting standard setting. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

The empirical component of the research attempts to shed light on this question by uncovering the nuts and bolts of the development methodology deployed by an SE during the coding and launch of an FOSS-based SI. Findings highlight the significant role of the founder's social vision; the challenges of accurately capturing and translating to software developers the nature and nuance of social problems; and, the incumbent issues in putting together a methodology that creates active user engagement throughout the software development process, overcoming difficult barriers such as language and culture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The participatory web that allows for active user engagement and gather intelligence has been widely recognised as a value add tool by organisations of all shapes and sizes to improve business productivity and efficiency. However, its ability to facilitate sustainable business-to-business (B2B) activities has lacked focus in the business and management literature to date. This qualitative research is exploratory in nature and fills this gap through findings arising from interviews of managers and by developing taxonomies that highlight the capability of participatory web over passive web to enable different firms to engage in business operations. For this purpose, two important interrelated functions of business i.e. operations and marketing have been mapped against three dimensions of sustainability. Consequently, this research demonstrates the ability of big data and social media analytics within a participatory web environment to enable B2B organisations to become profitable and remain sustainable through strategic operations and marketing related business activities. The research findings will be useful for both academics and managers who are interested in understanding and further developing the business use of participatory web tools to achieve business sustainability. Hence, this may be considered as a distinct way of attaining sustainability. © 2019 The Authors"

Theoretically grounded in Andreoni’s warm-glow giving theory and Sober and Wilson’s model of evolutionary and psychological giving, this work has high practical relevance, given the increasing demand for Islamic financial products. Loan-based crowdfunding platforms are important to the unique context of this research since Islamic religious constraints regulate monetary transactions involving lending. We used a scenario-based survey developed on the basis of a pilot study and confirmed by our manipulation check. The results show that “hedonism” represented by monetary interest negatively affected Muslim users’ willingness to engage in a loan-based crowdfunding project. This finding challenges the commonly agreed-upon egoistic motivator for loan-based crowdfunding platforms (i.e., monetary interest), which is based on Western Christian and Chinese Confucian capitalist economic and financial paradigms. Remarkably, we also found that Muslim funders’ level of willingness to engage on the hedonistic platform had an exponentially positive effect on the amount of money that funders were willing to lend. By contrast, “warm-glow giving,” manifested as belonging to a community, had no effect on users’ engagement.

Aggregated search coherence refers to the extent to which different sources on the SERP focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. In previous studies, we found that the query senses in a set of vertical results can influence user engagement with the web results (the so-called ""spillover"" effect). In this work, we investigate five research questions (RQ1-RQ5) that extend our prior work. First, we investigate the extent to which results from different sources focus on different senses of an ambiguous query (RQ1). Second, we investigate how the vertical-to-web spillover effect varies across different verticals (RQ2). Then, we examine whether the level of spillover depends on the vertical position (RQ3) and on whether the vertical results are displayed with a border and different-colored background to distinguish them from the web results (RQ4). Finally, we propose a new method for displaying results from a particular vertical that are more consistent with the query senses in the web results (RQ5). We evaluate this new method based on how it influences users to make more correct decisions with respect to the web results- to engage with the web results when at least one of them is relevant and to avoid engaging with the web results otherwise. Our results show the following trends. In terms of RQ1, our analysis suggests that the top results from the web search engine are more diversified than the top results from our four different verticals considered (images, news, shopping, and video). In terms of RQ2, we found a stronger spillover effect for the images vertical than the news, shopping, and video verticals. In terms of RQ3, we found a stronger level of spillover when the vertical was positioned at the top of the SERP versus to the right side of the web results. In terms of RQ4, we found an interesting additive effect between the vertical's position and displaying the vertical results enclosed in a border and with a different-colored background-the image vertical had no spillover when presented to the right side of the web results and with a border and background. Finally, in terms of RQ5, we found that our proposed vertical results selection approach can influence users to make more correct predictions about their level of engagement with the web results. © 2016 ACM."

We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement—defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs—with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality—like humor and emotion—is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content—like mentions of price and deals—is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality–related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers’ path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook’s EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook’s behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality–related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement).

In recent times firms have shown an increased interest in designing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactional technologies, such as conversational AI agents and chatbots, that obviate the need for having human service agents for the provision of customer service. However, the business impact of conversational AI is contingent on customers using and adequately engaging with these tools. This engagement depends, in turn, on conversational AI’s similarity, or likeness to the human beings it is intended to replace. Businesses therefore need to understand what human-like characteristics and competencies should be embedded in customer-facing conversational AI agents to facilitate smooth user interaction. This focus on “human-likeness” for facilitating user engagement in the case of conversational AI agents is in sharp contrast to most prior information systems (IS) user engagement research, which is predicated on the “instrumental value” of information technology (IT). Grounding our work in the individual human competency and media naturalness literatures, we theorize the key role of human-like interactional competencies in conversational AI agents—specifically, cognitive, relational, and emotional competencies—in facilitating user engagement. We also hypothesize the mediating role of user trust in these relationships. Following a sequential mixed methods approach, we use a quantitative two-wave, survey-based study to test our model. We then examine the results in light of findings from qualitative follow-up interviews with a sampled set of conversational AI users. Together, the results offer a nuanced understanding of desirable human-like competencies in conversational AI agents and the salient role of user trust in fostering user engagement with them. We also discuss the implications of our study for research and practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

A unique panel dataset was analyzed using a lagged model approach to determine the effects of signals of quality, awareness, and content variance on hospital prominence and quality as well as the impact of reputation on financial performance. The findings suggest that quality signals significantly impact patient-perceived quality ratings, and signals of awareness and content variance significantly impact prominence rating. Also, in contrast to prominence, perceived quality significantly and negatively impactsfinancial performance.

We focus on the way value creation can be enhanced through actively engaging end-users as co-creators of value in public procurement. The study employs an intensive single-case methodology, where the findings are based on qualitative data gathered on a Public–Private Partnership (PPP) -based school property procurement in Finland. The end-user's value potential does not rest only with creating individual user value but also with increasing e.g. the public service's social, environmental and political value. Our findings support the existing theoretical understanding according to which the most significant end-user value is achieved through interactive dialogue in the design phase of the public procurement project. The most significant advantages of active end-user engagement are especially seen in the usability of the provided public service.

Tailorable technologies support user goals, intentions, metaphor, and use patterns in the selection and integration of technology functions in the creation of new and unique information systems. We propose a theory of tailorable technology design and identify principles necessary for the initial design. Following a Kantian style of inquiry, we identified four definitional characteristics of tailorable technology: a dual design perspective, user engagement, recognizable environments, and component architectures. From these characteristics, we propose nine design principles that will support the phenomenon of tailoring. Through a year-long case study, we refined and evidenced the principles, finding found that designers of tailorable technologies build environments in which users can both interact and engage with the technology, supporting the proposed design principles. The findings highlight a distinction between a reflective environment, where users recognize and imagine uses for the technology, and an active environment in which users tailor the technology in accordance with the imagined uses.

Methods: Rapid systematic review of published and grey literature to identify methods or approaches to engagement in decisions about health service reconfiguration; and to examine how engagement has worked or not worked in specific examples of system change. Following a search for literature published in English from 2000 to March 2014, eight systematic reviews, seven primary studies and 24 case studies (of which 6 were exemplars) were included. We undertook a narrative synthesis to consider five aspects of engagement with health service reconfiguration. Results: Engagement varied in nature and intensity, and efforts generally involved multiple methods. There was no evidence on the isolated impact of any particular engagement method or collection of methods. In general, engagement was most likely to be successful when started early, when led and supported by clinicians, and when it offered opportunities for genuine interaction. The impact of engagement was variably measured and demonstrated, and frequently defined as process measures rather than the outcomes of proposals for service reconfiguration. Little was reported on the potential negative impact of service user engagement. Conclusions: Patients and the public can be engaged through various methods. Problems often arise because decisionmakers paid insufficient attention to issues considered important by patients and the public. Guidance setting out the stages of reconfiguration and opportunities for service user input could be a helpful practical framework for future engagement activity. Future evaluation and explicit reporting of engagement and impact is needed. © The Author(s) 2016."

However, little is known about how this occurs in the case of institutions’ brand pages and about its impact on existing member relationships. In examining the role perception about other users of a brand page plays on focal user identity construction, we found seeing other users demonstrating engagement behavior and recognizing similarity led to institutional identification through an increased perception of brand page sociability and identification with the page. Institutional distinctiveness also mediated the impact of other-user engagement behavior on member-institution relationships. These findings suggest traditional institutions can use social media to increase the visibility and accessibility of member-owned identity resources so as to facilitate opportunities for focal members to reinforce their self-concepts.

A key challenge for knowledge exchange platforms is how to motivate the desirable user engagement behaviors. Based on the motivation theory and the equity theory, we propose a set of hypotheses regarding the spillover effects of financial incentives on three types of desirable yet non-incentivized user engagement, namely, voluntary knowledge sharing, knowledge seeking, and social engagement. We obtain an archival data set from a major online knowledge exchange platform (Zhihu.com) to evaluate our hypotheses. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment wherein the platform implemented a paid knowledge sharing feature, we employ difference-in-differences models in tandem with propensity score matching to evaluate the spillover effects of financial incentives on the abovementioned types of engagements. Our results show that the initial financial incentives on the paid knowledge sharing activities further motivate users to voluntarily share more knowledge and increase their social engagement in the platform. However, the financial incentives have no significant impact on users’ knowledge seeking behavior. Our study suggests that the financial incentives not just have an effect on incentivized engagement, but they spillover to users’ desirable non-incentivized online engagement behaviors. Therefore, the overall positive effect of financial incentives to a platform is likely under-estimated in prior research. Our research offers implications to practice that financial incentives can be an effective strategy to nurture users, to seed content, and to enhance sociality of a platform. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

In this study, we operationalize four distinct stages of the social commerce platform, namely, social identification, social interaction, social shopping, and transaction based on salience theory. Using clickstream data, we empirically measure user engagement in these four states by modeling users’ incidence and time spent. Drawing from the PageRank algorithm, we capture the importance of ranking and distance on user engagement. The model also accounts for the effects of situational variables such as weekend; holiday; time of day; and user characteristics, such as gender and social media setting.

Answers to such questions could help mobile operating system and publishers to optimize advertising and service placement. In this article, we first conduct an empirical study for assessing how user characteristics, temporal features, and the short/long-Term contexts contribute to gains in predicting users' app dwell time on the population level. The comprehensive analysis is conducted on large app usage logs collected through a mobile advertising company. The dataset covers more than 12K anonymous users and 1.3 million log events.

To date, little is known about how companies can scientifically detect user engagement stages and optimize corresponding personalized-targeting promotion strategies to improve business revenues. This paper proposes a new structural forward-looking hidden Markov model (FHMM) combined with a randomized field experiment on app notification promotions. Our model can recover consumer latent engagement stages by accounting for both the time-varying nature of users’ engagement and their forward-looking consumption behavior. Although app users in most of the engagement stages are likely to become less dynamically engaged, this slippery slope of user engagement can be alleviated by randomized treatments of app promotions. The structural estimates from the FHMM with the field-experimental data also enable us to identify heterogeneity in the treatment effects, specifically in terms of the causal impact of app promotions on continuous app consumption behavior across different hidden engagement stages. Additionally, we simulate and optimize the revenues of different personalized-targeting promotion strategies with the structural estimates. Personalized dynamic engagement-based targeting based on the FHMM can, compared with nonpersonalized mass promotion, generate 101.84% more revenue for the price promotion and 72.46% more revenue for the free-content promotion. It also can generate substantially higher revenues than the experience-based targeting strategy applied by current industry practices and targeting strategies based on alternative customer segmentation models such as k-means or the myopic hidden Markov model. Overall, the novel feature of our paper is its proposal of a new personalized-targeting approach combining the FHMM with a field experiment to tackle the challenge of low engagement with mobile apps.

With this aim, video games can be an insightful source of inspiration, as they are specifically designed to maximise playing time, increase players' intentions of playing during the day or enhance their willingness to replay. In a gaming context, ‘time’ is an important factor for engagement because game designers can design the game time to retain players in the game environment. Drawing on social practice theory, which is increasingly used in Information Systems (IS) research, I conducted an ethnographic study in World of Warcraft (WoW) to understand how various temporalities are produced within a video game and the effects that they have on players' engagement. The findings show that game temporalities stem from the complex interaction between the design features of the game and the norms, routines and expectations that are part of the game practices. Moreover, these temporalities can engender temporal experiences that may stimulate engagement in various ways. The study contributes to IS literature by proposing a novel understanding of how time can be intentionally designed to sustain user engagement. Finally, it suggests that ‘time design’ in video games could inspire designs in broader IS contexts, such as in the gamification of online communities, crowdsourcing platforms and crowd working systems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Drawing on goal-setting theory, expectancy-value theory, and other related theories, this study models how hierarchical privilege levels and non-hierarchical incentives serve as motivational goals stimulating continued knowledge contribution. By analyzing a rich dataset collected from an online Q&A platform, we find that closeness to the next hierarchical privilege level does, indeed, have a curvilinear relationship with continued knowledge contribution. Interestingly, non-hierarchical incentives, including reputation gains and granted badges, help to maintain continued knowledge contribution. Notably, user reputation diminishes the effects of both privilege levels and granted badges on future knowledge contribution. This implies that these gamification mechanisms, while potentially powerful for incentivizing user engagement in knowledge contribution, might not work as effectively for participants with already established reputations in the online community.

Past literature documented the operational value of the content generated by social media users but paid little attention to the users’ incentives to generate and share content. We fill in the gap by linking a user’s social network to her content contribution. Specifically, we distinguish the role of the followee network (the group of people being followed by the user) from the role of the follower network. When a user follows more people, she may spend more time in consuming content than generating content (the substitution effect); she may gain more conflicting information from her followees, obfuscating her incentives to generate content (the information overload effect). Conversely, gathering more information from her followees may facilitate her own content generation (the information sharing effect). Through different identification strategies using multiple datasets from two influential social media platforms, we find that the effects of followees and followers are asymmetric in signs and different in magnitudes. Most notably, a user generates less content with a larger followee network, especially when she faces more time constraints.

The existing research in display advertising has predominantly concentrated on the content of advertising; however, our focus is on optimizing the timing of display advertising. In practice, users are constantly adjusting their engagement with content as they process new information continuously. The recent development of emotional tracking and wearable technologies allows platforms to monitor the user’s engagement in real time. We model the user’s continuous engagement process through a Brownian motion. The proposed optimal policy regarding the timing of behavioral advertising is based on a threshold policy with a trigger threshold and target level. Specifically, the platform should insert the advertisement when the user’s engagement level reaches the trigger threshold, and the length of the advertisement should let the user’s engagement level drop to the target level. Analogous to the familiar idea of “price discrimination,” the methods we propose in this study allow the platforms to maximize their revenue by “discriminatory” customization of the timing and length of the advertisement based on the behavior of individual users. Finally, we quantify the benefits of the proposed policy by comparing it with the practically prevalent policies (i.e., preroll, midroll, and a mix of the two) through a simulation study. Our results reveal that, for a wide range of settings, the proposed policy not only significantly increases the platform’s profitability but also improves the completion rate at which consumers finish viewing the advertisement.

As a positive side effect, using digital games in a GLAM environment contributes to increasing the visitors' engagement and making the collections more popular. Along this line, we present in this article an online game for museum environments that serves two goals: asking users to engage with the artworks in a collection in a playful environment, and collecting their feedback on artwork similarity, which may be used by curators to rethink the organisation of digital exhibitions and in general to better understand how visitors perceive artworks. The game is called PAGANS (Playful Art: a GAme oN Similarity), and is designed to collect similarity judgements about artworks. The software was implemented following some principles of gamification in order to quickly leverage similarity information in the cultural heritage domain while increasing user engagement and fun. The game, involving pairs of players, was used during two large public events to collect different data about the players' behaviour and to investigate how these dimensions correlate with aesthetic perception. A thorough statistical analysis shows that age and (self-declared) gender correlates with the time and the number of moves needed to complete a session. These dimensions also link to the relevance of colour and shape in judging similarity. These findings suggest that, although artwork similarity is very subjective and may vary based on a person's background, some trends can be identified when considering the subjects' gender and age. This could have some practical implications; for example, it could be used to support art curators in creating digital exhibitions by grouping artworks in novel, user-centred ways.  © 2021 ACM."

First, posts’ titles are subjected to electronic classification and subsequent counting of main parts of speech and other language elements. Then, statistical models are built to examine the relationships between these elements and user engagement, controlling for variables identified in previous research. FindingsThe number of adjectives and nouns, adverbs, pronouns, punctuation (exclamation marks, quotation marks and ellipses), question marks, advisory words (should, shall, must and have to) and complexity indicators that appear in content community posts’ titles relate to post popularity (scores: number of favourable minus unfavourable votes) and number of comments. However, these relationships vary according to the category, for example, text-based categories (e.g. Politics and World News) vs image-based ones (e.g. Pictures). Research limitations/implicationsWhile the relationships uncovered are appealing, this research is correlational, so causality cannot be implied. Practical implicationsAmong other implications, companies may tailor their own content community post titles to match the types of language related to higher user engagement in a particular category.

However, it is unclear if such initiatives are also beneficial for SM profile owners such as influencers, who are the prime content creators on the SM platforms who use SM posts to build their influence within their network of followers. Our study investigates the effect of introducing one such new SM feature: the “story” on the creation and consumption of SM posts. Leveraging social penetration theory, we hypothesize the influence of introducing story feature on (1) the frequency of SM post creation by profile owners and (2) the extent of follower engagement with SM posts. Employing a quasi-experimental design, we find that the introduction of the story feature reduces the frequency of SM post creation, but the enhanced self-disclosure through the story feature increases follower engagement with the SM posts. However, these effects are moderated by the situating culture of the SM communities: while low-power-distance cultures value profile owners’ self-disclosure, high-power-distance cultures exhibit a mixed influence. Advancing literature on social penetration theory and SM user engagement, our study demonstrates that new self-disclosive SM content creation features do not necessarily benefit all the concerned stakeholders and that the effectiveness of such features might vary from one community to another. Hence, the intended impact of introducing new SM features needs to be carefully evaluated by SM platforms in a holistic manner. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This study aims to use a user engagement theoretical lens to examine the factors that influence app engagement over time and may prompt disengagement. Design/methodology/approach: A phenomenological exploration of the lived experience was used. Women from a lower socioeconomic background (based on the occupation and employment status of the household’s primary income earner) were randomly assigned to use one of two apps for a minimum of eight weeks. Multiple data collection methods, including accompanied shops, researcher observations, interviews, participant reflective accounts and questionnaires, were used at different time-points to examine engagement. Theoretical thematic analysis was conducted to explore the engagement experience and relevant social, personal and environmental influences. Findings: Healthy food involvement appears to drive app engagement. Changes in situational involvement may contribute to fluctuation in engagement intensity over time as the saliency of personal goals change. Negatively valenced engagement dimensions may contribute to the overall expression of engagement. A lack of congruency with personal goals or an imbalance between perceived personal investment and value was expressed as the primary reasons for disengagement. Research limitations/implications: Situational involvement may act as a trigger of different engagement phases. There is a need to better distinguish between enduring and situational involvement in engagement research. Practical implications: Individual characteristics may shape engagement and propensity for disengagement, which highlights the practical importance of incorporating tailored features into app design. Originality/value: Findings broaden the current conceptualisation of engagement within the digital space and prompt a reconsideration of the role of situational involvement and negatively valenced dimensions throughout the engagement process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We report on a laboratory study (N = 32) that investigated the effects of three different cognitive abilities (perceptual speed, working memory, and inhibition) in the context of aggregated search. Aggregated search systems combine results from multiple heterogeneous sources (or verticals) in a unified presentation. Participants in our study interacted with two different aggregated search interfaces (a within-subjects design) that differed based on the extent to which the layout distinguished between results originating from different verticals. The interleaved interface merged results from different verticals in a fairly unconstrained fashion. Conversely, the blocked interface displayed results from the same vertical as a group, displayed each group of vertical results in the same region on the SERP for every query, and used a border around each group of vertical results to help distinguish among results from different sources. We investigated three research questions (RQ1–RQ3). Specifically, we investigated the effects of the interface condition and each cognitive ability on three types of outcomes: (RQ1) participants’ levels of workload, (RQ2) participants’ levels of user engagement, and (RQ3) participants’ search behaviors. Our results found different main and interaction effects. Perceptual speed and inhibition did not significantly affect participants’ workload and user engagement but significantly affected their search behaviors. Specifically, with the interleaved interface, participants with lower perceptual speed had more difficulty finding relevant results on the SERP, and participants with lower inhibitory attention control searched at a slower pace. Working memory did not have a strong effect on participants’ behaviors but had several significant effects on the levels of workload and user engagement reported by participants. Specifically, participants with lower working memory reported higher levels of workload and lower levels of user engagement. We discuss implications of our results for designing aggregated search interfaces that are well suited for users with different cognitive abilities. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."

A historical account is presented that focuses particularly on the activities of the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics and key ecological economics research activities. Achievements of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand are assessed, using a range of quantitative and qualitative data. The main areas of expertise developed by Australian and New Zealand ecological economists were found to be: theoretical foundations and visions for ecological economics; biodiversity and resilience; input-output analysis; heterodox valuation approaches; analysis of economy-environment interactions; sustainability indicators; sustainable agriculture, fisheries and oceans; and energy/thermodynamics. Both countries are ranked at the top (or near the top) of the world rankings in terms of per capita ISEE membership and publication rates in Ecological Economics. A defining feature of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand has also been its practical and problem-solving focus and the level of end-user engagement. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges that face the future development of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

KT tools provide health consumers with research knowledge to inform health decision-making and may foster 'effective consumers'. Thus, the purpose of this scoping review was to describe the state of the field of previously published effectiveness research on child health-related KT tools for parents/caregivers to understand the evidence-base, identify gaps, and guide future research efforts. Methods: A health research librarian developed and implemented search strategies in 8 databases. One reviewer conducted screening using pre-determined criteria. A second reviewer verified 10% of screening decisions. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer. A descriptive analysis was conducted and included patient-important outcome classification, WIDER Recommendation checklist, and methodological quality assessment. Results: Seven thousand nine hundred fifty two independent titles and abstracts were reviewed, 2267 full-text studies were retrieved and reviewed, and 18 articles were included in the final data set. A variety of KT tools, including single- (n = 10) and multi-component tools (n = 10), were evaluated spanning acute (n = 4), chronic (n = 5) and public/population health (n = 9) child health topics. Study designs included: cross-sectional (n = 4), before-after (n = 1), controlled before-after (n = 2), cohort (n = 1), and RCTs (n = 10). The KT tools were evaluated via single primary outcome category (n = 11) and multiple primary outcome categories (n = 7). Two studies demonstrated significant positive effects on primary outcome categories; the remaining studies demonstrated mixed effects (n = 9) and no effect (n = 3). Overall, methodological quality was poor; studies lacked a priori protocols (n = 18) and sample size calculations (n = 13). Overall, intervention reporting was also poor; KT tools lacked description of theoretical underpinnings (n = 14), end-user engagement (n = 13), and preliminary research (n = 9) to inform the current effectiveness evaluation. Conclusions: A number of child health-related knowledge translation tools have been developed for parents/caregivers. However, numerous outcomes were used to assess impact and there is limited evidence demonstrating their effectiveness. Moreover, the methodological rigor and reporting of effectiveness studies is limited. Careful tool development involving end-users and preliminary research, including usability testing and mixed methods, prior to large-scale studies may be important to advance the science of KT for health consumers. © 2017 The Author(s)."

The purpose of this paper is to examine how three generic types of marketer-generated content (affiliative, injunctive and utilitarian content) drive user engagement by considering distinct motivational paths and the role of users’ preference for intimate (vs broad) social networks. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a field survey and a scenario experiment among social media users across different brands from three different product categories. They examine the impact of marketer-generated content on user engagement while considering the moderating role of network intimacy (i.e. the mutual confiding within a user’s social network in terms of small social circles) and the mediating role of user motivations (i.e. autonomous vs controlled motivation for community membership). Findings: The findings show that affiliative content (i.e. content that highlights shared values) drives user engagement through autonomous motivation, and utilitarian content (i.e. content that highlights tangible benefits) drives user engagement through controlled motivation. Notably, injunctive content (i.e. content that demands specific user behavior) is not a promising instrument to increase user engagement in social media brand communities when not targeted correctly. Research limitations/implications: The authors link three generic content types derived from literature on communal systems to user engagement, demonstrate the motivational underpinnings of their translation into engagement behavior and show that network intimacy can explain why the same content type can impact user engagement through two motivational paths. Practical implications: The authors present three types of content that marketers can craft to trigger users to engage with a brand’s social media community and show when this content is most effective and why. By examining the moderating role of network intimacy, this research aims at providing targeting implications to social media marketers. Originality/value: This research provides new insights on the effectiveness of marketer-generated content. The authors reveal two motivational paths that compete in explaining the overall effectiveness of different types of marketer-generated content to fuel user engagement.

Evidence from other European welfare states suggests that the case in favour of localised innovation may be particularly compelling in urban labour markets, where there can be pockets of severe disadvantage, but also networks of community stakeholders better able to support collaboration and innovation through user engagement. Drawing on the conceptual and empirical literature on ‘collaborative innovation’, this article discusses an example of good practice in innovative localised activation in city labour markets (‘Making It Work’ services targeting unemployed single parents in Scotland’s two largest cities). Our analysis is based on 92 in-depth interviews with single parents and key stakeholders involved in service design and delivery. We identify benefits associated with multi-stakeholder collaborative governance, distributive leadership in programme management, and practices promoting the co-production of innovative services with single parents at the frontline. However, we also note tensions between localised services committed to innovation and empowerment, and an increasingly less interventionist but more punitive liberal welfare state.

These variables are participatory architecture, organizational integration, and the presence of specific mechanisms for opportunism prevention and resolution. The fsQCA analysis suggests that specific combinations of these three organizational variables at network level enable high firm performance through the development and protection of business network commons.

The results show that using these apps has a positive persuasive impact, increasing interest in the brand and also the brand's product category. The relevance of the product category makes no difference, but apps with an informational/user-centered style were more effective at shifting purchase intention, most likely because this style focuses attention on the user, and therefore encourages making personal connections with the brand.

Hundreds of air quality apps are now available; however, there is scant information on how effective these mobile apps are at educating stakeholders about air pollution and promoting behavioral change to protect their health. In this paper, we test how intrinsic and extrinsic motivations can enhance users’ engagement with air quality information through an app, and favor changes in protective behavior. We developed an air quality app, AirForU, with a built-in research study that was downloaded by 2740 users. We found that engagement was higher for users with intrinsic motivations, such as those who are health conscious, either because they are suffering from heart disease or other conditions aggravated by air pollution, or because they exercise frequently and want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Extrinsic motivations such as notifications were also effective.

To elucidate this relationship, this research uses Social Presence Theory to describe how conversational skill influences perceived social presence and ultimately anthropomorphism of a chatbot. We conducted a series of studies in which 450 participants interacted with CAs exhibiting varying levels of conversational skill. We show that people perceive a more skilled CA to be more socially present and anthropomorphic than a less skilled CA.

Many methodological and theoretical differences among prior studies have been suggested as possible causes for inconsistent findings. This research is an attempt to resolve inconsistent data despite differences that may exist in prior studies. Data from 25 studies were meta-analyzed to test the separate effects of user participation and user involvement on six system success variables. Results showed that user participation had a moderate positive correlation with four success measures: system quality, use, user satisfaction, and organizational impact. The correlation between user participation and individual impact was minimum. User involvement generally had a larger correlation with system success than did user participation. Overall, these findings indicate that both user involvement and user participation are beneficial, but the magnitude of these benefits much depends on how involvement and its effect are defined."

In practice, however, the vast majority of a community’s users (≈90%) remain inactive (lurk), simply observing contributions made by intermittent (≈9%) and heavy (≈1%) contributors. Our research examines increases and decreases of types of user engagement in online communities using hidden Markov models. These models characterize latent states of user engagement from trace user activity or lack of activity. The resulting framework then differentiates lurkers who can later become workers (i.e., engaged in the community) from those who will not. Differentiating lurkers who can be engaged from those who cannot enables managers to anticipate and proactively direct their resources toward the users who are most likely to become or remain workers (i.e., heavy contributors), thereby promoting community welfare. Analysis of 533,714 posts from an online diabetes community shows that incorporating latent user engagement variables can significantly improve the accuracy of welfare prediction models and guide managerial interventions. Application of our framework to five additional communities of various contexts demonstrates its generalizability. Copyright: © 2020 INFORMS."

In this work, we carry out two complementary studies to investigate the impact of response latency on users' searching behaviour in web search engines. We first conduct a controlled user study to investigate the sensitivity of users to increasing delays in response latency. This study shows that the users of a fast search system are more sensitive to delays than the users of a slow search system.Moreover, the study finds that users are more likely to notice the response latency delays beyond a certain latency threshold, their search experience potentially being affected.We then analyse a large number of search queries obtained from YahooWeb Search to investigate the impact of response latency on users' click behaviour. This analysis demonstrates the significant change in click behaviour as the response latency increases. We also find that certain user, context, and query attributes play a role in the way increasing response latency affects the click behaviour. To demonstrate a possible use case for our findings, we devise a machine-learning framework that leverages the latency impact, together with other features, to predict whether a user will issue any clicks on web search results.

The theoretical explanations are particularistic, and the empirical findings are fragmented, sometimes divergent, and reveal unexplained variations of effects. Managers and academics have thus had little guidance on how to explain and combat digital piracy. To help fill this gap, the present meta-analysis synthesizes past research on digital piracy and accumulates 1,373 effect sizes from 174 studies collected in 36 countries. The meta-analysis identifies the key drivers of users' engagement in digital piracy and tests a new, comprehensive model that integrates all prior theoretical perspectives-social influence and control, outcome evaluation, dilemma solving, and reinforcement. The model explains 42%-53% of the variance in digital piracy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors and identifies the reinforcement perspective as the strongest theory. A moderator analysis shows that the influence of key drivers varies with cultural dimensions linked to the theoretical perspectives-individualism moderates social influence and control variables, masculinity moderates dilemma-solving variables, and uncertainty avoidance moderates reinforcement variables. These findings provide guidance for future digital piracy research and also have managerial implications in terms of possible revisions to antipiracy measures. © 2019 INFORMS."

The model is tested using data collected from 178 users of a gamified IS in a global consulting company. The results demonstrate that although FE and AE are complementary forces, AE is more salient than FE for explaining continuance intention.

But food and food-related decisions are sometimes experienced as difficult or stressful (Mennell et al. 1992) due to a lack of appropriate food knowledge (Colatruglio and Slater 2014). In this context, mobile apps are flourishing in order to help people make healthier food choices (Flaherty et al. 2019). While the literature on mobile food applications is rich in the health field for their potential to change dietary behaviors (Covolo et al. 2017; Gilliland et al. 2015; Mateo et al. 2015; McKay et al. 2018; Mendiola et al. 2015; Michie et al. 2017; Palacios et al. 2018), there is limited research on how consumers engage with them (Bezançon et al. 2019; Doub et al. 2015; Flaherty et al. 2018, 2019; Gilliland et al. 2015; Samoggia and Riedel 2020). In this paper, we ask: how can we better understand the consumer engagement process for nutritional apps? Using data from 15 semi-structured interviews with users of the French nutritional app Yuka, we conducted thematic analysis, applying a lens of affordance theory (Gibson 1977). Proposed by Gibson (1977), the concept of affordances designates the potentialities of action perceived by the individual, resulting from an interaction between the latter and their environment. Affordances are an analytical tool to explore the complex relationship between the individual and technology (Hutchby 2001). Our data and analysis helped us to arrive at a model of engagement based on affordances, in which we examine the impact that emotions experienced during the affordance actualization stage has on user engagement at various points of app usage. Through our research, we highlight the dynamic nature of engagement. As users attempt to actualize affordances offered by nutrition apps, emotional mechanisms influence (re)adjustments in usage, which in turn influence modes of engagement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Study Setting: Six hospitals in England, United Kingdom. Study Design: Qualitative case study. Data Collection: We undertook qualitative semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations of meetings and system use, and collected organizational documents over three time periods from six hospitals. Thematic analysis was initially undertaken within individual cases, followed by cross-case comparisons. Findings: We conducted 173 interviews, conducted 24 observations, and collected 17 documents between 2011 and 2015. We found that perceived individual and safety benefits among different user groups tended to facilitate engagement in some, while other less engaged groups developed resistance and unsanctioned workarounds if systems were perceived to be inadequate. We identified both the opportunity and need for sustained engagement across user groups around system enhancement (e.g., through customizing software) and the development of user competencies and effective use. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to move away from an episodic view of engagement focused on the preimplementation phase, to more continuous holistic attempts to engage with and respond to end-users. © Health Research and Educational Trust"

Being an effective type of communication (Chattopadhyay and Basu 1990; Chung and Zhao 2003), parodies and humorous messages have been widely used in advertising strategies (Strick et al. 2013). Although such messages were previously prerogative of professionals, today any user with a computer and some creativity may produce a user generated advertising parody, so much that both positive and negative ad parodies populate the social media sphere. While several studies have analyzed the effect of positive ad parodies undertaken by brand loyalists on behalf of the brand (Berthon et al. 2008), very few research have investigated the influence of consumer-created negative ad parodies on both users and the parodied brand (Jean 2011; Sabri and Michel 2014; Vanden Bergh et al. 2011), and still no studies, to our knowledge, have focused on consumers-created negative ad parodies of brand misconduct. To this aim, the present research focuses on UGC negative ad parodies that seek to entertain consumers while spoofing a brand irresponsible behavior. Specifically, the study investigates the effect of such consumer-created contents in fostering negative word-of-mouth, while exploring the mediating role of users’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) beliefs. Moreover, the paper examines whether the display of a corporate/brand comment may mitigate this effect. The study adopts a mixed methodology including a content analysis and an experimental design (Ihantola and Kihn 2011; Bellucci et al. 2019). The first study analyses users’ comments of a total of 8 user generated YouTube videos parodies about British Petroleum and it shows how consumer-created ad parodies spur negative users’ engagement, which result in the expression of negative feelings, opinions and willingness to share the video. The second experimental study tests the hypothesized relationships and it demonstrates that negative parodic videos influence the users’ willingness to engage in negative WOM because of the activation of (negative) CSR beliefs. Moreover, results show how this effect can be attenuated by the display of a company’s comment. While previous research focused on positive consumer-created ad parodies, this study investigates negative ad parodies effects on sharing intentions and negative WOM and it sheds lights into the underlying mechanism under which negative ad parodies influences users’ sharing behavior. Moreover, the study provides valuable insight for practitioners as it highlights the need for the parodied brand to develop detailed responses strategy to negative parodies (Sabri and Michel 2014). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Users interpret relevant cues from the information and respond to it through engagement behavior such as online word of mouth through social media.

The theoretical model is tested in two empirical studies. One uses actions of six representative Internet service firms and their users’ online word-of-mouth behavior over a 50-month period. The second is a two-stage controlled laboratory experiment designed to establish causal linkages between firm actions and user engagement. The study provides support for its hypotheses and offers several key findings. First, the firm's actions influence user engagement behavior. Specifically, when a firm launches a larger number of actions, users are engaged in a higher volume of activities and deeper activities. When a firm employs actions that are simpler and easier to understand, users are engaged in deeper activities but not necessarily a larger volume of activities. Second, user engagement is a missing link between a firm's actions and performance. Specifically, engagement depth positively mediates the effects of both action volume and action simplicity on performance. By contrast, engagement breadth positively mediates the effect of action volume but not the effect of action simplicity on performance. Collectively, the study contributes to a clearer understanding of the role of users in firms’ actions and provides key insights regarding how firms benefit from user engagement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Drawing on the social contagion literature, the authors examine the effect of online social connections on users' product purchases in an online community. They assess how product, user, and network characteristics influence the social contagion effect in users' spending behavior. The authors use a unique large-scale data set from a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game community-consisting of users' detailed gaming activities, their social connections, and their in-game purchases of functional and hedonic products-to examine the impact of gamers' social networks on their purchase behavior. The analysis, based on a double-hurdle model that captures gamers' decisions of playing and spending levels, reveals evidence of “social dollars,” whereby social interaction between gamers in the community increases their in-game product purchases. Interestingly, the results indicate that social influence varies across different types of products. Specifically, the effect of a focal user's network ties on his or her spending on hedonic products is greater than the effect of network ties on the focal user's spending on functional products. Furthermore, the authors find that user experience negatively moderates social contagion for functional products, whereas it positively moderates contagion for hedonic products. In addition, dense networks enhance contagion over functional product purchases, whereas they mitigate the social influence effect over hedonic product purchases. The authors perform a series of tests and robustness checks to rule out the effect of confounding factors. They supplement their econometric analyses with dynamic matching techniques and estimate average treatment effects.

Our survey (N = 1,346, aged 13 and older) maps social media users’ engagement experiences with Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat and their experiences with and evaluations of advertising on these platforms. Our findings show that engagement is highly context specific; it comprises various types of experiences on each social media platform such that each is experienced in a unique way. Moreover, on each platform, a different set of experiences is related to advertising evaluations. It is further shown that engagement with social media advertising itself is key in explaining how social media engagement is related to advertising evaluations. The general conclusion is that there is no such thing as “social media.”. Copyright © 2018 Hilde A.M. Voorveld, Guda van Noort, Daniël G. Muntinga, and Fred Bronner © 2018, © Hilde A.M.

We investigate how Service Design, as a human-centered and creative approach to service innovation, can reframe NSD processes to implement value cocreation. Multiple case studies on Service Design projects indicate that design-centric approaches can contribute to the whole NSD process in a way that connects organizations’ managerial practices to value cocreation, in that (1) contextual and holistic understandings of user experiences can inform value propositions that better fit users’ value-in-use, (2) codesign with creative supporting tools can facilitate value cocreation by helping users better apply their own resources, (3) prototyping can optimize firms’ resource and process configuration to facilitate users’ engagement with the service, (4) aligning system actors to the user experience can organize and mobilize them to better support users’ value creation, and (5) user-centered approaches and methods can help organizational staff build long-term capability for supporting users’ value creation. Based on the link between Service Design, NSD, and value cocreation, we propose a conceptual NSD model, geared toward value cocreation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential. © American Marketing Association 2021."

The collaboration and active user’s role has prompted co-design to become one of the strategies for successful product development. This research proposes engagement mechanism factors that improve user engagement and encourage customers to use and buy through the co-design web service. The factors are interactive feedback with the service provider and collecting points from social media sharing. We also propose user innovativeness to moderate the predictors and improve user engagement. We utilise a scenario-based experiment for a co-design clothing web store in Indonesia. Results show that additional interactive contact with the service provider will increase a user’s engagement and likelihood of use. The effect is greater for customers with lower levels of innovativeness. In contrast, adding game elements (e.g., points) has no significant contribution to customer engagement and use intention. This research shows the value of engagement mechanisms in enabling the value co-creation process in a co-design platform. This study contributes by providing a framework for the service provider to deploy an engaging co-design service by considering both service provider factors (i.e., engagement mechanics embedded on the web) and customer-related factors (i.e., user innovativeness level) to encourage customers to use and buy through online co-design service. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019."

This theorizing goes beyond user-aided, participatory design to consider users as designers in their own right during the ongoing creation and recreation of information systems. Recent theorizing about an emerging class of tailorable systems proposes that such systems undergo an initial, primary design process where features are built in prior to general release. Following implementation, people engage in a secondary design process where functions and content emerge during interaction, modification, and embodiment of the system in use. This case study reveals that people are engaged designers, framed by dualities in behaviors including planned and emergent behaviors, and participatory and reifying behaviors. We contribute to design science research by extending work on tailorable systems, investigating processes of secondary design in a highly interactive system suited to support user engagement. We also contribute more broadly to design science research by explicitly extending behavioral aspects associated with the use of information system artifacts."

Most of these digital environments are offered under “freemium” pricing to facilitate adoption and network effects. In these settings, users' early social interaction and experience often have a substantial impact on their longer term behavior. On this background, we study the impact of an algorithmic system that matches new users to existing communities in an assortative manner. We devise a machine learning-based matching system that identifies users with high expected value and provides them the option to join highly active, in terms of engagement and expenditure, teams. We deploy this mechanism experimentally in a digital social game and find that it significantly increases user engagement, spending, and socialization. This finding holds for more active communities and overall. Teams matched with low-activity new users are negatively impacted, leading to an overall more segregated social environment. We argue that social experience and social behavior in groups are likely mechanisms that drive the impact of the matching system. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS."

We identify the importance of user engagement and informedness in explaining corporate reputation and examine three design factors that likely affect user engagement in a corporate Twitter channel. We conduct an exploratory 2 × 2 × 2 experiment among Twitter users to collect data. We find that the depth of the relationship among users, the level of corporate involvement, and the purpose of the channel interactively influence user engagement. Our findings suggest that deeper relationships among users of a corporate Twitter channel lead to higher user engagement when the level of corporate involvement with the channel is high and when the channel has a specific purpose, but not when the level of corporate involvement is high and the channel has a generic purpose. Surprisingly, when the channel has a generic purpose, a high degree of corporate involvement actually decreases user engagement. This finding implies that, under certain circumstances, a lower degree of corporate involvement in a social media channel may be more desirable. We also find that channel credibility positively influences user informedness. This is the first study that examines the dynamics of communication through a corporate Twitter channel. It contributes to the previous research related to social media by identifying engagement and informedness as two major factors that influence firms' reputation. Our research can help marketing and social media managers to decide on channel design aspects, such as whether to require users to register with an identity or to allow anonymous participation, whether to allocate dedicated employees to respond to user requests, and whether to set up different channels for different purposes."

Sixty-nine percent of all Facebook users are fans of one or more company pages, 92% of marketers are already using Facebook today, and 75% of the marketers are planning on increasing their activity in the future (eMarketer 2012). Those phenomena obviously are evidence of the importance of social media marketing, which can have a significant impact on marketers’ business. Undoubtedly, establishing a social media presence is essential for marketers, however, the strategies for communicating with customers have changed constantly in SNSs. Those interactive media change marketing communications from a traditional one-way process to a multiple-way process with the interaction of the marketer and consumer. Despite the growing interest in social media, measuring the effectiveness of interactive media has been incomplete (Rosenkrans 2009). That suggests the need for new measures of the effects and effectiveness of social media in order to understand consumer response to marketing communications. This study offers a broad perspective on measuring the effectiveness marketing communications that include interaction as a comprehensive social media analysis. The objective of this research is to explore the issue of how to define and measure the effectiveness of social media as supporting digital content marketing. Digital content marketing is one of the dominant marketing strategies in the digital market (HiveFire, 2011). Digital content marketing includes the creation and publication of original content such as blog posts, photos, videos, website resource pages, case studies or white papers to enhance a brand’s visibility. Since the digital content is downloaded for immediate viewing and use, SNSs are essential either to distribute the digital content or to generate website traffic to the businesses’ website, which is the hub of the actual digital information. There are several major performance indicators of social media usage such as message frequency, audience reach, and audience engagement. Using those social media performance metrics, this study develops a comprehensive model to estimate the audience size of a businesses’ website, which is related directly or indirectly consumers to digital content marketing effectiveness through social media. A page view metric, which is the act of browsing a specific web page on the website of the business is used to estimate website traffic on the business’s website. An Internet-based coupon deal company provided the data used for analysis. A stepwise time series regression model was created to examine the relationship of frequency, engagement, and reach for two social media platforms – Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TW) on the page views of the company website. The ten social media variables – FB posts, TW Tweets, FB Likes, FB Comments, FB clicks, WT Replies, TW Retweets, TW clicks, FB Friends, and TW Followers – were used as independent variables with page views as the dependent variable. The least significant predictors were dropped and additional regression analyses were performed until a final model was obtained with all variables significant at the 0.05 significant level (P&lt;.05). The interpretation of the results focuses on the final model with the non-significant predictors eliminated. The result supports that all independent variables except TW Followers are significant and have a positive association with page views. First of all, it is important to note that the relationships between metrics of social media performance and page views are correlational, but not causal. Moreover, according to the present study findings, the message frequency on Facebook and Twitter such as FB Posts and TW Tweets are significantly positively related website traffic as well as social media users’ engagement variables. Even though the effect on page views vary between each predictors, the overall metrics of this study support the importance of the critical characteristics of social media such as social impressions, clicks, messages shared, and network size. Since page views could be translated to a company’s digital content marketing goals because it would present the effect of existing and potential consumers who are sensitive to marketing efforts (i.e. digital content). This study highlights that the seriousness of understanding a variety of new sources of online information that are created, initiated, circulated, and used by consumers intent on educating each other about products, brands, services, personalities, and issues. One of the most exciting aspects of this study is seeing how marketing efforts and communication such as campaigns and promotions through social media have evolved and have turned into strategic plans. Since this study is one of the first empirical investigations in the marketing communication field related to measuring social media’s effectiveness based on traditional media measurements – reach and frequency concepts – additional research remains to be done to better understand the social networking phenomena. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science."
