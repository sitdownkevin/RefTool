Despite this increase in popularity, there is a dearth of empirical studies that examine the factors influencing the continued usage intention of these applications (hereafter, apps). Drawing on stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory, this paper investigates the features of stock trading apps that generate consumer engagement and consequently, continued app usage intention. In study 1, through semi-structured interviews, we establish four key drivers of customer engagement with stock trading apps, and two possible moderators influencing the relationship between customer app engagement and continued usage intention. In study 2, we examine these key drivers by surveying stock trading app users from three different Facebook stock trading communities. The results confirm that the social presence and security features of these apps are significantly associated with consumer stock trading app engagement. We also find that fear of uncertainty and perceived corporate hypocrisy weaken the effect of customer app engagement on continued app usage intention. The study findings add to the literature on app usage and customer engagement and provide insights for fintech service companies to help them understand the factors that enhance consumer engagement with these apps. © 2024"

Such a phenomenon has led us to explore how price image and sugrophobia, a psychological feeling of being taken advantage of, would influence consumers' future behavioural intention in the context of luxury retail store. Informed by a survey of 400 consumers, this study adopts the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S–O-R) model to examine how price image triggers consumer perceptions (i.e., perceived value, trust and attitude) and results in behavioral intention. Sugrophobia is included in the S–O-R model to assess its moderating effect. Data analysis using SEM-PLS demonstrates that a retailer's price image has a positive effect on consumers' perceived value, trust, attitude, and future behavioral intention. Sugrophobia, in turn, is found to weaken the relationship between price image and consumer perceptions. The study thus highlights the relevance of sugrophobia among risk-averse consumers and the necessity to manage sugrophobic consumers effectively in the context of a luxury retail store. Implications of the study are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 262 valid questionnaires were collected. Data were collected using the purposive sampling method and tested using the partial least squares (PLS) approach. Findings: Monetary cost is positively related to only one organism-related factor which is perceived greenwash fear. All organism-related factors are positively related to response, which is green hotel patronage intention. Attitude mediates the relationship between perceived greenwash fear and green hotel patronage intention, as well as perceived behavioural control and green hotel patronage intention. Research limitations/implications: A longitudinal study can be performed in the future to observe the actual green hotel patronage behaviour of customers. Practical implications: Green hoteliers should focus on the development of communication strategies to enhance their corporate reputation. Green hoteliers also need to build trust by showing their green initiatives are genuine, identify consumers who are willing to pay more for green hotels and offer promotions with price incentives such as frequency discounts, coupons and rebates to increase interest and trialability. Originality/value: Few studies have focused on the use of monetary cost as a stimulus in the S-O-R model to predict green hotel patronage intention. This study also tested the mediating effect of attitude, one of the organism-related factors, in the model. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, there is little knowledge about the role of cognitive and affective attitude towards the intention to enroll a university based on a Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework. The purpose of this study is to explore the intrinsic relationship between stimulus (university quality and university image) and organism (cognitive attitude and affective attitude) as a process in influencing the intention to enroll a university. Online surveys are used to collect data. The hypothesis was tested empirically using SmartPLS. The results of this study indicate that intention to enroll is influenced by the affective attitude stimulus. University quality has a positive and significant effect on cognitive attitude, affective attitude, and university image. Then, university image has a positive and significant effect on cognitive attitude and affective attitude.

The extant literature offers limited guidance on managing the consumer journey in an omni-channel environment across different retail types. Using the S–O-R framework as its basis, this study generates novel insights by examining how different types of retailers influence consumer perceptions of channel integration (CPCI) as well as consumer empowerment, trust, satisfaction, and patronage intention. Data from 736 consumers was collected using purposive sampling to target those who interact with retailers from high-end specialty stores, department stores, and hypermarkets. The data was then analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). We find that consumers from high-end specialty stores, hypermarkets, and department stores have different perceptions when patronising the omni-channel retail business.

Design/methodology/approach: The author proposes a sequential experiential consumption model by applying Jacoby’s refined stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory to better understand the experiential sequences in foreign music consumption among young generations in the US market. The proposed model, using structural equation modeling (SEM), examines a cognitive permeable role and a hierarchical affective mediating role. Also, moderating roles of generation and gender are simultaneously tested in overall and specific causal relationships. Findings: The refined S-O-R framework is superior to a linear one in better understanding young consumers’ online experiential foreign music consumption behavior. Moreover, hierarchical sequenced affective organismic behavior is crucial to enhance young consumers’ online music consumption experiences to regulate subsequent behavioral responses. Furthermore, gender differences but no generational differences exist in the experiential consumption process among young consumers. Nevertheless, the strength of S-O-R factors affecting experiential consumption seems idiosyncratic simultaneously in gender and generation. Practical implications: The study suggests foreign music streaming services boost profitability by focusing on young consumers' psychological ownership and tailored experiences, encouraging a shift from freemium to premium subscriptions. Also, the findings recommend adopting phygital experiences using technologies like AR, VR and MR to enhance engagement and create unique, emotionally resonant experiences for young consumers, thus fostering a more profitable business model. Originality/value: The authors address under-researched topics relevant to young generations by applying Jacoby’s refined S-O-R framework to foreign music consumption through online streaming. This approach delves into a lesser-explored consumer behavior framework, highlighting young generations’ musical trends. The model reveals cognitive and affective roles, offering advantages over traditional linear S-O-R models. It also uniquely incorporates the moderating effects of generation and gender in music consumption studies, addressing a gap in music-related studies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In the current study, stimuli represent the chatbot service quality and chatbot awareness, prompting positive and negative emotional responses among Chinese users. However, these responses are influenced by the user's experience with chatbot usage, and trust is considered the organism in the S-O-R framework. In response to the user's ultimate trust, experience, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and e-brand loyalty are enhanced. Similarly, our study framework is supported by the S-O-R theory. Data was gathered by convenience sampling and a cross-sectional research approach from 301 Chinese consumers of luxury fashion brands. The proposed relationships were tested using PLS-SEM through PLS-Smart software. The findings showed that AI-chatbot service quality significantly influences customer e-brand loyalty. Furthermore, chatbot user trust, experience, and electronic word of mouth significantly mediate the relationship between AI-chatbot service quality and customer e-brand loyalty. In a nutshell, applying S-O-R theory, our proposed model results provide valuable insights into the dynamics of AI-chatbot-driven interactions among Chinese luxury fashion brand consumers. Further, it explains the pivotal role of AI-chatbot service quality in fostering customer trust and e-brand loyalty.

Moreover, the study elaborates on the path from the desire to stay to positive WOM and patronage intentions by considering the mediating role of shopper satisfaction. A survey-based study comprising a sample size of 451 mall shoppers has been developed to test the proposed research model. The results indicate that the desire to stay mediates the relationship between shoppers’ positive attitudes towards color schemes and music, on one hand, and shopper satisfaction and positive WOM, on the other hand. Although the desire to stay has a direct effect on positive WOM, it does not directly impact patronage intention. However, the latter path becomes significant when considering the mediating role of shopper satisfaction, indicating that satisfying mall stays enhance desirable outcomes.

The findings indicate differences between VR and AR in several aspects. To elaborate, in the context of VR, vividness significantly influences perceived authenticity, an effect not found within the AR setting. Furthermore, interactivity impacts the sense of presence in AR, but this is not the case in VR. Within an AR setting, a user's sense of presence directly influences their level of satisfaction, yet no corresponding impact was found in VR.

A third-order model is established to demonstrate the multi-faceted aspects of service quality and mediating effects of perceived brand image, satisfaction, and e-word of mouth. Using structural equation modeling, data collected from Hong Kong, a metropolis where mobile services empower its citizens, showed the interrelationships among service quality and possible outcomes (i.e., perceived brand image, user satisfaction, e-word of mouth, and user loyalty). Findings also indicate that the influence of perceived service quality on user loyalty could only be achieved through perceived brand image and user satisfaction. This is a timely study during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lockdown and social distancing arrangements created challenges for citizens to search for information in public libraries in person. Our findings and suggestions reiterate the importance of considering the usability concepts when analyzing the service quality of each unique app. They also provide insights for practitioners in developing the next generation of apps for smart public information services and call for further investigation into the proposed hierarchical model and other potential factors related to service quality. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This study aims to use the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model as a theoretical lens to examine whether internal communication (IC) (stimulus) evokes FLEs’ organizational identification (emotional) and job satisfaction (cognitive), and whether these in turn shape FLE customer-oriented behavior (response). The study also tested whether these mediated relationships are moderated by perceived communication formalization. Design/methodology/approach: The hypothesized mediated and moderated effects were tested using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of 293 full-time salespeople working for a large general insurance company. Findings: Both organizational identification and job satisfaction simultaneously mediate the relationship between IC and customer-oriented behavior. Perceived communication formalization was found to weaken the mediated relationship between IC and customer-oriented behavior, but only when this is via job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: This study has shown that where IC is positively viewed by FLEs, it can be leveraged as a key driver by organizations to evoke simultaneous positive emotional and cognitive reactions, leading to increased customer-oriented behavior. Practical implications: This study informs both theory and practice related to effective IC among customer-contact FLEs. Originality/value: The study shows how IC can simultaneously produce two simultaneous emotional and cognitive reactions leading to FLE customer-oriented behavior and how these mediated relationships can be moderated by perceived communication formalization.

Despite the growing awareness and use of natural products, little is known about the enablers and barriers that influence consumers' brand love toward them. The present study attempts to address this gap and better explain consumer behavior toward natural products by utilizing the stimuli-organism-response (S–O-R) theory. The study rests on the premise that certain stimuli influence the internal state of consumers (i.e., the organism), which, in turn, shape their response to products and services. This study uses health consciousness and environmental concern as the stimuli, both facilitators (natural content and regional product) and inhibitors (usage and image barriers) as the internal state of the ‘organism’, and brand love as the response. Based on analysis of 720 responses, the study empirically reveals that health consciousness and environmental concern significantly influence the consumers' internal state, as represented by the identified facilitators and inhibitors . Three of these, namely, regional product, image barriers, and usage barriers, are found to shape brand love for natural products.

Findings: The results show that product description and product content were positively associated with product involvement, while product display did not exhibit a significant relationship between it and product involvement. As hypothesized, product involvement mediated the relationship of product description and product content with consumer purchasing intention. The return policy leniency was also found to positively moderate the mediation path of product content on purchasing intention through product involvement. Originality/value: This study bridges a gap in the literature on the influence of three kinds of product information on purchasing intention through product involvement in a cross-border e-commerce context.

We investigate the effect of interactivity of brands' marketing activities on Facebook fan pages on continuous participation (i.e., commenting and sharing) intentions. The S–O-R (stimulus-organism-response) framework is used to examine consumers' psychological states (perceived brand fan page experience and attachment) and subsequent behavioral responses (continuous participation intentions) after being stimulated (social media marketing activity interactivity). Using an online questionnaire, this study surveyed the top 15 brands' Facebook fan page users worldwide. We obtained 216 valid responses and used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data. Results show that the more interactive a brand's marketing activities are on its Facebook fan page, the higher the perceived experience. In addition, perceived experience positively affects brand fan page attachment. Perceived experience and brand fan page attachment positively affect continuous participation intentions.

As the sharing economy strives to recover from pandemic-induced losses, it is crucial to consider factors that might help sharing-economy firms navigate through difficult times. Moreover, value-co creation has been addressed previously in sharing economy research as a unidimensional construct with constrained applicability. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response (S–O-R) framework, the present study focuses on ethical marketing as a strategy for identifying consumer responses—including value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay—that may benefit sharing-economy firms. We have collected the empirical data from n = 403 consumers in the sharing economy. Analyses through structural equation modelling tests reveal that ethical marketing influence value co-creation, self–brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay. Contrary to our expectations, value co-creation has no influence on consumers' willingness to pay; however, the relationship between value co-creation and consumers' willingness to pay is fully mediated by self–brand connection. Based on empirical results, this study contributes to existing theoretical knowledge regarding ethical marketing and value co-creation literature in the sharing economy and proposes practical implications, including how consumers would be willing to co-create value, establish a self–brand connection, and are more likely to pay in response to ethical marketing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data collected. Findings: Using the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) theory and customer engagement model as the theoretical foundations, this study confirms that SMMEs are a strong predictor and play a vital role in developing and building social media customer engagement and brand loyalty. This study also found that the cognitive aspect of CBE is a key driver in enhancing brand loyalty. Furthermore, cognitive social media CBE positively mediated the relationship between SMMEs and brand loyalty. Contrary to expectations, emotional CBE had no mediating effect on the relationship between SMMEs and brand loyalty.

Although students continued their academic careers despite hardships, as yet little is known about how they experienced and adapted to various pandemic-induced changes to their academic and personal lives. We address this gap through a qualitative exploration of student experiences of navigating the new normal which they were abruptly thrust into near the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Using a guided introspection methodology and a Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, we unearth a dynamic process of psychological and behavioral changes that students experienced in response to the environmental changes brought about by the pandemic. We theorize that environmental dissolution and displacement trigger psychological reorientation, causing students to undertake behavioral practices of restructuration and reconfiguration that, over time, result in a degree of psychological revaluation. Our overall framework represents a fluid conceptualization that is not only more descriptive of real-world student progress but also more parsimonious in its account of key dimensions of student experience during the pandemic. We conclude by noting the implications of our framework for marketing educators and administrators, especially given the growing popularity of remote working. © The Author(s) 2021."

The study has proposed a number of situational and external cues that, through the customers’ affective and cognitive incentives, stimulate their impulsivity toward purchasing. Methodology: This study extensively reviewed scholarly research works published in national and international peer-reviewed journals published between 2012 and 2024 identified through specific keyword searches and iterative search results. Henceforth, this study excluded the research articles that did not comply with the relevance and the search criteria. All the research articles considered for the literature review are written in English. Findings: This study used a direct antecedent-consequent link to provide a thorough explanation of the phenomenon of impulsive buying. It has discussed how buyers’s cognitive and affective emotions play a role in what leads to their impulsive purchasing behavior. Practical Implications: The propositions would assist marketers in unveiling the enigma of the consumers’ need recognition that is often triggered by consumers’ trait changes due to psychological shifts; henceforth, practitioners would design effective marketing communications. Originality: This research is distinct from previous studies since it used the S-O-R paradigm and included a mediation role for affective and cognitive emotions in order to try and resolve the current disagreement among researchers regarding the influence of peer pressure on impulsive buying behavior. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Although the effect of omnichannel retailing on business is increasingly recognised, privacy concerns remain a subject of debate and a delicate issue which could potentially inhibit its growth. Grounded in the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) model, the current study investigates consumer behaviour in omnichannel retailing and uses Psychological Reactance Theory (PRT) as the theoretical basis to examine the moderating effect of privacy concerns. A quantitative approach was adopted by means of self-administered questionnaires. 736 consumers were sampled, and the data were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings show that consumer perception of channel integration (CPCI), consumer empowerment (CE), and trust significantly affect patronage intention in omnichannel retailing. In addition, when privacy concerns are low, the effects of CPCI and CE on trust are found to be stronger. It underscores the need to synergize channel integration, retailer-consumer relationship empowerment and effective mitigation of privacy concerns in the omnichannel retailing context.

In this framework, stimuli show brand inauthenticity and corporate wrongdoing, prompting negative cognitive and emotional responses among individuals. These responses, affected by customers' attachment to the brand, are the organisms in the SOR model. Attachment theory advocates that customers form emotional bonds with brands akin to human relationships. Perceived brand betrayal, an emotional response, is a critical organism in this conceptual framework, curtailing the heresy of customers' attachment to the brand. This brand betrayal perception catalyzes brand avoidance and demand for reparation. Data were collected from Chinese consumers of luxury fashion brands and tested proposed relationships using PLS-SEM in PLS-Smart 4.0. The findings showed that brand inauthenticity and corporate wrongdoing positively predict perceived brand betrayal, significantly leading to brand avoidance and demand for reparation. Overall, the SOR model, mutual with the lens of attachment theory, sheds light on the complex dynamics of customer responses to brand inauthenticity and corporate wrongdoing, illuminating the process of brand avoidance and the subsequent call for reparation.

Design/methodology/approach: This survey included 371 guests who assessed their experiences at three Brazilian hotels. Structural equation modelling tested the hypothetical model supported by the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974). Findings: The quality perceived by hotel guests (stimulus) positively impacts perceived value, positive emotions and satisfaction and negatively affects negative emotions (organism). Price (stimulus) negatively impacts perceived value but does not affect satisfaction. Perceived value positively impacts satisfaction. Satisfaction positively impacts WOM and eWOM (responses). The HGBE-SNS moderates the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that simultaneously demonstrates the relationships between perceived quality, price, perceived value, positive and negative emotions, satisfaction, WOM, eWOM and HGBE-SNS. Hotels must offer their guests high-quality services to positively impact’ perceived value, positive emotions, satisfaction and WOM. Low prices boost the perceived value but do not directly increase guest satisfaction. Satisfied hotel guests share their experiences via WOM, but high HGBE-SNS is crucial to boost eWOM. © 2023, Gustavo Quiroga Souki, Alessandro Silva de Oliveira, Marco Túlio Correa Barcelos, Maria Manuela Martins Guerreiro, Júlio da Costa Mendes and Luiz Rodrigo Cunha Moura."

We also propose that anchor characteristics (i.e., attractiveness) may moderate the effects of social cues. To examine the above effects, we conduct a within-subject eye-tracking experiment. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we find that both herding message and interaction text can capture exogenous attention. In terms of endogenous attention to the product and anchor, interaction text shows a negative distracting effect, whereas herding message shows a positive spillover effect, negatively moderated by anchor attractiveness. Moreover, endogenous attention is positively related to purchase intention, while the effect of exogenous attention is relatively more complex, involving the competing mechanisms of the distracting effect and social influence.

However, little attention has been given to how the individual influencers' use of multiple social networking sites affects their followers' behavioral intentions. Hence, this academic gap warrants further exploration. Drawing on cue consistency theory, social identity theory, and stimulus-organism-response framework, this research proposes three research questions and constructs an integrated research model to explore how the influencers' cue consistency affects the social identification of their followers, subsequently influencing their behavioral intentions. A structural equation modeling technique is performed to analyze the data of 510 valid respondents. The findings show that influencers' consistent cues (i.e., information and image consistency) across social media have positive impacts on followers' cognitive and affective identification toward the influencers. Furthermore, the determinants for followers' purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth intention are affirmed to serve as both cognitive and affective identification. Especially, the results indicate that the relationships between followers’ social identifications and behavioral intentions are moderated by the type of influencer (i.e., lifestyle vs. review).

However, the specific role of various customer experience dimensions, such as sensory experience, intellectual experience (design and employees), social experience, and pragmatic experience, as stimuli to enhance in-store customer service and shopping experiences remains somewhat unclear. Furthermore, the concept of the in-store customer experience is gaining increasing popularity, significantly improving in-store customer satisfaction. Nevertheless, its development through two key experience taxonomies (in-store service experience and in-store shopping experience) has remained largely unexplored.

The results further revealed exposure to online information sources led to increased information overload and cyberchondria. Information overload was also a strong predictor of cyberchondria. Perceived severity of the situation and cyberchondria had significant impacts on people's intention to make unusual purchases and voluntarily self-isolate. Future research is needed to confirm the long-term effects of the pandemic on consumer and retail services. © 2020 The Authors"

Tourists’ travel is driven by several motivational factors, which lead them to plan or continue on a travel trip. However, since the emergence of COVID-19, travelling has become a major issue for the whole travel industry. The recent spread of Omicron makes most post-pandemic studies futile. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of motivation factors that affect tourists’ travel intention in the controlled pandemic context. The mediating role of perceived value and the moderating role of perceived travel risk were examined as well. The Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory was adopted as the theoretical foundation of the research framework. A quantitative online survey was used to collect data from 388 Malaysian and Taiwanese travelers. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse the data. The results show that escape, kinship, and people are direct and indirect motivation factors that influence tourists’ intention to travel via perceived value. Notably travel risk indicated no moderating effect. The results of this study provide useful insights into tourists’ post-pandemic behaviour that offer practical implications for Asian business. © 2021, Asia Business Research Corporation.

Research has largely examined drivers of initial acceptance of digital assistants (DAs) and has yet to fully understand the factors driving or deterring consumers’ passion towards DAs and the behavioural outcomes. Drawing on the stimulus-organism-response framework, this study examines a unique set of factors (usefulness, ease of use, privacy concern, and localisation) that act as stimuli to drive an organismic state of passion for DAs, and how this produces behavioural responses of word-of-mouth (WOM) intention and commitment to DA use. The study also examines how technology anxiety moderates passion's impact on WOM intentions and commitment. The findings show that usefulness, ease of use, privacy concern, and localisation are significant explanatory variables of consumers’ passion towards DAs. Furthermore, passion towards DAs results in WOM intentions and commitment to its use. The findings further show that passion's effect on DAs in explaining WOM intentions and commitment is weakened by technology anxiety. Lastly, passion is the mediating mechanism through which usefulness, ease of use, privacy concern, and localisation impact WOM intentions and commitment.

Previous research supports this notion of colors as a powerful cue, colors being showed to influence emotional responses (Babin et al. 2003; Bellizzi and Hite 1992), but also brand evaluation (Labrecque and Milne 2012), price perception (Babin et al. 2003; Puccinelli et al. 2013), and purchase intentions (Gorn et al. 1997; Labrecque and Milne 2012). Given this role of cognitions following color exposure, it may be that cognitive inferences explain the mixed evidence found for one particular color: red. This color often carries positive meanings, as it is associated with love or energy, but also negative ones, priming, for example, the notions of danger, mistakes, ban, transgression, or war (Elliot et al. 2007). Surprisingly, however, no research to date has examined how the negative associations induced by the color red might negatively affect emotions and behavior. Therefore, the current research relies on recent studies highlighting the aforementioned importance of color for food products to examine the effect of the color red on consumers’ responses to food packages. Specifically, because of its negative meanings and specifically its association with mistakes (Mehta and Zhu 2009), the color red may prompt negative feelings that are closely linked to transgression, more specifically guilt, an emotion that results from the transgression of moral or social standards (Baumeister et al. 1994). To test this notion, this research builds on the S-O-R model and psychological literature on guilt to posit hypotheses about the relationship among red, negative cognitive associations, and guilt. The research tests the hypotheses in a series of three studies. Because of the historical opposition between red and green (Nakshian 1964), A first study using chip packages as stimuli demonstrates the indirect effect of the color red (vs. green) on guilt through the mediating role of negative cognitive associations. Then, two additional studies using candies and cereal bar packages, respectively, replicate these effects and also demonstrate the role of the vice versus virtue product type. The results highlight the moderating role of perception of the product as a vice product, with the color red leading to stronger negative associations and guilt for such products.

Twenty-four (24) participants made 60 apparel purchase decisions. Utilizing machine learning, we study whether and how various neural circuits are engaged in purchase decision-making in regard to different types of visual sensory information. The functional neuroimaging results suggest high accuracy (highest: 95%, Rotation condition) in predicting purchase decisions using brain activity in the product evaluation process. Furthermore, cross-category validation reveals the activation patterns under the Rotation condition most successfully predict choices across the other two presentation conditions: this suggests a potential universal brain activity pattern in these apparel purchase decisions. Finally, we found some brain regions (such as the cerebellum) that are less likely to be associated with purchase decisions but are considered influential in predicting online apparel purchase decisions in the context of watching a rotation product video. The cerebellar activation may suggest association with spatial cognition and virtual navigation in addition to motor control.

National culture was a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: A self-administered online survey collected data from a convenience sample of 762 football fans from Brazil, China and Germany. Findings: The PLS-SEM results support the S-O-R based model, indicating that football fan-loyalty behaviours are determined by fanship and cumulative satisfaction with the team. Fan experiences, in turn, are also found to be influenced by fan perceptions relating to socialisation, team interest, football interest and transaction satisfaction—elements over which the football team's management may exert some degree of control. Some national cultural differences were found, with three of the model's 12 structural paths significantly different for Germany vis-à-vis Brazil.

It concentrates on key elements such as employee engagement, trust in GenAI and attitudes toward its implementation. This exploration is motivated by the ongoing evolution of GenAI, which presents managers with the crucial task of understanding and integrating this technology into their strategic frameworks. Design/methodology/approach: We collected 251 responses from managers and senior managers representing companies that have embraced GenAI in Spain. A hierarchical regression analysis was employed to examine the hypotheses. Subsequently, mediating effects and moderated mediation effects were scrutinized using the bias-corrected bootstrapping method. Findings: The data analysis suggests a significant enhancement in employee engagement and performance from a managerial perspective, attributed to improved attitudes and trust toward the adoption of GenAI. This conclusion is drawn from our research conducted with samples collected in Spain. Notably, our findings indicate that while positive attitudes toward GenAI correlate with enhanced engagement and performance, there exists a weakening effect on the significant positive impact of GenAI adoption in the workplace. This suggests that GenAI is still in its early stages of adoption within these companies, necessitating additional time for managers to develop greater confidence in its efficacy.

Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 592 valid samples in organic food chain stores and markets by random sampling method. Meanwhile, structural equation modelling was adopted to test hypotheses. Findings: The research findings indicate that consumer preference for natural food was the most important factor for enhancing purchase intention, followed by health consciousness, health risk, attitude towards organic food and trust in labelling. Perceptions of nutritional value positively influenced attitudes towards organic food and trust in labelling, followed by perceptions of environmental effects; conversely, attitudes towards organic food labelling had the least effect on increasing trust in labelling. Attitudes towards organic food labelling was the most important factor influencing positive attitudes towards organic food, followed by consumer perception of environmental protection effects. Originality/value: This study demonstrates the relative influence of different variables on organic food purchase intention.

The past five decades of research have successfully validated the S-O-R model in offline and online contexts. However, there is still room for improvement. In particular, hedonic aspects have been proposed as distinctive aspects to differentiate companies from their competitors. Previous researchers have (1) been somewhat reluctant to investigate dominance and other emotional responses, and (2) produced mixed results regarding the impact of atmospherics and emotional responses on behavior. Building on this tradition of research, this study investigates the S-O-R model by incorporating delight as an additional emotional response and tests the moderating effects of consumers' involvement and shopping environments (three-way interactional effects) in connection with the links among atmospherics, emotions, and intentions. The current findings demonstrate that the model fit better for low-involvement consumers than for high-involvement consumers. This was true for both offline and online environments. The results show that layout and information are two important factors in pleasing and arousing consumers, especially in the case of low-involvement consumers, and that delight is determined by both arousal and pleasure but is a determinant of both intention and word-of-mouth only for consumers with low involvement, whether they are in offline or online environments.

Using the stimulus-organism-response model and affect-as-information theory, we devised and tested a theoretical framework linking both a cognitive path and an affective path to approach eWOM adoption on SNSs. Two curiosity constructs - informational deprivation epistemic curiosity (D-EC) and interest-type epistemic curiosity (I-EC) - are regarded as moderators of the cognitive path and the affective path, respectively. Data collected from 445 respondents support all of our hypotheses. The results show that beyond the conventional cognitive path (cognitive stimuli and the credibility of eWOM), the affective path (affective stimuli and arousal) can also contribute to eWOM adoption. We also find that SNS users focus on different stimuli of SNSs, depending on their levels of D-EC and I-EC.

However, the literature review provides positive, negative, and even null results in the S-O-R model, producing doubts about its generalization capacity in the retail field. The study provides a quantitative summary of the bivariate findings regarding the antecedents and the consequences of organism trait (i.e., emotions). The study here corroborates the generalizability of the results into S-O and O-R stages. The authors also confirm the emotions' dependency in the organism factor. The results show that the relationship between arousal and pleasure was significant and positive. Both emotions are responsible for much variation on hedonic and utilitarian motivation for shopping. Arousal-hedonic and pleasure-hedonic relationships have stronger effects from the 28 relationships, indicating that consumer emotions and recreational motivation for shopping are strongly associated.

This area of studies has grown in the retailing literature encompassing all the environmental cues that surround shoppers and influence their behavior. However, studies undertaking a comprehensive approach of shopping atmosphere factors are lacking. This research uses the atmospherics’ classification provided by Turley and Milliman (2000), the general interior variables (GIV). This framework encompasses an extensive list of atmospherics including flooring and carpeting, color schemes, lighting, music, temperature, etc. This research empirically examines the effect of the Shopping Mall’s GIV on shopper’s emotions and behaviors. For this purpose, a convenience sample of mall shoppers was investigated. Data has been analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test the proposed research model. The results indicate several direct relations between color schemes, mall lighting, scent and temperature, on one side, and shopper satisfaction and the desire to stay at the mall, on the other. When considering the mediating role of emotional states, pleasure and arousal mediate the impact of many relations between different variables and shopper satisfaction and desire to stay. Specifically, pleasure mediates the impact of flooring and carpeting, color, music, and physical characteristics and both outcomes, Arousal mediates only the relationship between color, music, and the desire to stay at the mall. The mediation of dominance is not supported. In addition to contributing to studies using the S-O-R model, and extending the atmospherics macro level literature, the current study demonstrates how different combinations of variables influence consumer emotions and shopper behavior. Moreover, the study adds to research about the effect of general interior variables on satisfaction and desire to stay at the mall while considering the mediating role of shopper’s emotional states. Furthermore, the study provides several managerial implications; although retailers are already aware of the importance of atmospherics, this study stresses the importance of considering all the variables surrounding shoppers during their shopping visit and sheds light on how atmospherics influence consumers. Importantly, the current study demonstrates how different formulas of variables aligned with each other to influence different outcomes. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Furthermore, empirical research on digital signage (DS) is scarce (Bae et al. 2016) – particularly in the emerging market context – and does not address shoppers’ experience of DS as mall atmospheric stimuli. This paper presents a study which explored South African shoppers’ experience of DS in order to understand how it might influence their emotional responses and shopping behaviors. It draws inspiration from the fields of environmental psychology and retail atmospherics to propose that when contemporary shoppers experience retail atmospheric stimuli such as DS as positive, they are likely to stay longer, visit a mall more often, and/or spend more. Brakus et al. (2014) demonstrated that DS in the retail environment evokes brand experience on a cognitive level when providing product information (thus utilitarian value) but evokes sensory and affective dimensions when offering spectacle and entertainment value (hedonic). In this study, the utilitarian and hedonic value of DS as retail atmospheric stimuli is explored by using the Mehrabian-Russell model of environmental influence (also referred to as the S-O-R model) as a theoretical lens. This model is widely used to examine the effect of retail atmospherics on shoppers’ responses (see Mishra et al. 2014). Acknowledging earlier research on shopping experiences and mall atmospherics (Arnold and Reynolds 2003; Fiore and Kim 2007; Sit et al. 2003), an exploratory qualitative investigation was conducted. In-depth interviews with 30 shoppers guided by visual stimuli on DS in three super regional mall environments were used to collect the data. The findings confirmed that digital mall signage as atmospheric stimuli can lead to an emotional reaction that influence shoppers’ behavioral responses in malls, supporting the theoretical model. The content and the quality or quantity of exposure can shape shoppers’ experience of the retail atmosphere. The results suggest that shoppers who see the DS as offering hedonic value will experience enjoyment; and improvement to the utilitarian value of content would also enhance the shopping experience. Overall DS is regarded as positive enhancement and a potential valuable source of information and entertainment. The narrative accentuated the demand for tailored content rather than universal marketer-driven inducements. Specific recommendations to enhance or improve the experience of shoppers exposed to digital mall signage are made. References Available Upon Request © 2019, Academy of Marketing Science."

Building upon the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, the current study constructed an integrated model to demonstrate perceived destination eco-friendly reputation as a stimulus; consumption emotions (positive and negative) as organism; tourism satisfaction, recollection, tourist environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) as response. Notably, tourists' recollection is seen within this S-O-R framework as the formation mechanism for prescribed action and consequently as an example of script theory and the generation of consumer responses, thus connecting elements of behavioral and cognitive psychology in a unified framework. Survey data from 522 Chinese tourists were used to empirically examine the integrated tourist ERB model. The findings suggest that destination eco-friendly reputation positively impacts both positive emotions and tourist satisfaction, and eco-friendly reputation negatively impacts negative emotions. Positive emotions significantly and positively influence tourist satisfaction, tourists' recollection, and ERB. Conversely, negative emotions have a significant negative effect on these constructs. Moreover, tourist satisfaction positively influences recollection and ERB, and recollection in turn positively affects ERB.

About 164 respondents in Peninsular Malaysia were included in this primary questionnaire survey, of which 81 (49.4%) favored branded perfumes and 83 (50.6%) preferred non-branded perfumes. The attractive packaging and seasonal variations in fragrance and flavor of the perfumes were highly prioritized by the respondents. The significant findings of the study revealed that habit of using perfume mediates the relationship between message framing and perceived quality on the purchase decision of perfumes. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference between branded and non-branded perfumes when the quality of the perfume was well maintained. Also, there was no significant difference in the usage of perfumes between men and women and between the races Malays and Chinese.

Data collected from 523 participants provide strong support for the proposed model. The results indicate that compelling immersive experience and perceived benefits are important mediators explaining the theoretical mechanism of how social presence affects loyalty. The presence of moderators such as group identification reinforces the influence of social presence on immersion. In addition, this study also suggests that perceived benefits differentially affect the two facets of e-loyalty (i.e., revisit intention and positive WOM). Specifically, revisit intention is mainly driven by the perceived hedonic benefit while positive WOM likelihood is largely determined by the utilitarian and social benefits.

It was further concluded that online retailers should not only put a heavy emphasis onto utilitarian attributes but also take hedonic attributes in consideration while formulating online retail strategy. © 2017 ESIC & AEMARK"

A multitrait-multimethod matrix approach confirms the convergent and discriminant validity of the measure employed. A causal modeling analysis suggests that enduring involvement may work through situational involvement to influence consumer responses.

A questionnaire was constructed and data were collected on customers served by financial salespeople working at five banks. A structural equation model was used to empirically assess the proposed research model. The empirical results reveal that the two dimensions of value added by the salesperson (enjoyable interaction, perceived risk) partially mediate the relationship between salesperson attributes (expertise, trustworthiness) and customer loyalty to the salesperson. In addition, the relationship between salesperson expertise and salesperson equity is partially mediated by both dimensions of value added by salespeople. However, the two dimensions of value added by salespeople fully mediates the positive relationship between trust worthiness and salesperson equity. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study are addressed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Based on Mehrabian and Russell's Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework (1974), this study proposes that high-technology product attributes elicit consumers' cognitive (attitude) and affective states (pleasure and arousal), contributing to their approach-avoidance behavior. High-technology product users (N=408) participated in surveys. The results provide support for the model. Among six factors of high-technology product attributes (usefulness, ease of use, innovativeness of technology, visual appeal, prototypicality, and self-expression), the latter four have major influences on approach behavior through attitude (cognitive state) and pleasure (affective state). Supplemental analysis shows that attitude and pleasure influence approach-avoidance behavior directly, but that arousal affects approach-avoidance behavior indirectly via pleasure. © 2011."
