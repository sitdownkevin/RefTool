On what scale can we consider the process and uses of virtual money to be ethical? What are the misuses related to their use? In this chapter, we study the ethical and environmental issues of cryptocurrencies. First, regarding the environmental issue, the major cryptocurrencies use a large amount of electricity for mining, which has a significant impact on the energy production system and global warming. Second, we discuss the new type of Dark economy that has emerged with these currencies, thanks to the anonymity of transactions. We particularly emphasize the unethical use of cryptocurrencies, namely the virtual money laundering and tax evasion, the financing of illegal activities (i.e. illicit products, terrorist financing) and cyber-attacks. Third, we develop the ethical use of virtual money and show that this kind of currency, which guarantees the protection of privacy and anonymity of transactions, can be a good solution to mitigate transaction costs and reduce poverty. They can also be beneficial in the context of debt crises and hyperinflation. Thus, cryptocurrencies per se are not evil; it is their uses that can be. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Energy consumption; Environmental impact; Illegal activities; Virtual currencies",""

In-game purchases, virtual currency, game feature design for heterogeneous consumers, and strong competition are key challenges for game providers. This study addresses the determination of optimal game design strategies for game providers in the presence of heterogeneous players and copycat competitors. Specifically, the study incorporates pricing of virtual goods/currency into the free-to-play (F2P) mobile game design for both monopoly and duopoly cases and characterizes the optimal strategies for game providers in terms of pricing of virtual goods/currency and the game challenge level. In both cases, we derive optimal pricing and game challenge levels for game providers. In a monopoly setting, it is always in the game provider’s best interest to make the game as challenging as possible. In a duopoly setting, a reasonable first mover advantage in the form of discounted value to copycat games is required for the original providers to create original games. Our results provide useful guidelines for mobile game developers facing a threat from copycat competitors. Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","",""

Therefore, exploring what specific factors and design attributes may affect the sales of virtual items has become an important issue. This research draws upon prior studies on currency numerosity, contextualizing them to online game contexts to develop several theory-based predictions about how online game currency numerosity affects players' perceived expensiveness and consequently their purchase intention of virtual items. To test these predictions, we conducted six experiments that investigate numerosity effects in massive multiplayer online games (MMOs) where players can exchange real money for game currency based on an exchange rate in order to purchase virtual items. Results indicate the following: (1) when the game currency exchange rate is not salient (e.g., game currency exchange rate is not mentioned or players have sufficient game currency in their account), players consider a virtual item as more expensive if the price is high (versus low) in numerosity; but (2) when the game currency exchange rate is salient (e.g., game currency exchange rate is mentioned and no additional information indicates that it is irrelevant), players consider a virtual item as cheaper if the price is high (versus low) in numerosity; in addition, (3) in the latter case, numerosity increases players' purchase intention of nonsocial, but not social, virtual items through the mediating effect of perceived expensiveness. Our notable findings contribute to the existing literature on numerosity and provide guidance for the design of virtual currency systems in MMOs.  © 2020 INFORMS.","Currency numerosity; Exchange rate salience; Massive multiplayer online games; Perceived expensiveness; Virtual currency systems; Virtual items","Purchasing; Sales; Social networking (online); Currency exchange rates; Design attributes; Exchange rates; Massive multiplayer online games; Mediating effect; Provide guidances; Purchase intention; Virtual currency; Finance"

This study provides a brief overview of the existing research in this area. It compares positions taken in the literature by authors on some of the key policy issues releva nt for central banks when thinking about the issuance of digitalized legal tenders. We examine the implications of government issued digital alternatives to traditional currencies for monetary policy effectiveness, payments and settlements, and financial m arket stability. We also discuss recent advances in financial technology to improve the making of payments and settlements, which might help contribute to financial inclusion. At the same time, new technologies represent challenges for regulatory authoriti es, for instance related to efforts to contain anti money laundering and prevent financing of terrorism. A number of authors argue that government issued digital currency is necessary to address the flaws in private crypto currencies, and to improve moneta ry policy effectiveness. Central banks have begun to analyze possible features of digitalized legal tenders, to better understand the policy considerations involved and effects these could have for interest rate transmission and financial markets, but ther e is no clear consensus on key modalities associated with digitalized legal tenders. Moreover, many central banks do not regard privately issued virtual currencies as a serious threat to traditional currencies. Given the ongoing debate, it is difficult to make firm predictions about the impact of central bank issued digital currencies on monetary policy transmission and financial markets at this point. © 2019 Sciedu Press.","Digital currencies; Financial market st ability; Monetary policy effectiveness; Payments and settlements",""

The objective of the proposed research is to conduct a comparative analysis of three distinct extended reality applications used in cultural heritage experiences. The proposed workflow integrates advanced 3D scanning technology and additive manufacturing techniques to produce tangible replicas which are further enhanced using extended reality technologies, such as augmented reality, desktop virtual reality, and immersive virtual reality. To evaluate the developed extended reality applications, we have conducted various System Usability Scale tools to assess applications' usability while also trying to identify the most appropriate application that can be integrated within the museum exhibition. From a utility point of view, we found no notable differences in the user perceptions between proposed solutions, whereas from a usability and satisfaction point of view, the most preferred solution was the augmented reality one.

To observe this, we looked at the contents of the value design of the eight types of cryptocurrencies currently in use in the market.

To address this challenge, a series of motivation factors that range from self-interest driven to prosocial-oriented motives have been identified by scholars. As members participate in continuous contributions and community activities alike, their status or positions within the virtual communities would change, which may influence their cognition and behavior. While status-seeking can lead to greater contributions and a better performance, research has yet to study in a comprehensive manner how an individual's status-standing shape one's recognition and behavior in a systematic way. To fill this research gap, a comprehensive theoretical model based on the status theory of collective action is proposed to explain how status standing moderates the impact of different types of motivations (self-interest vs. prosocial) on continuous contributions in virtual communities. Our findings suggest that improved status-standing can enhance the motivational incentives of virtual rewards and peer recognition, while boosting the prosocial motivation of opinion leadership to contribute content in virtual communities. Overall, this study not only suggests a comprehensive view of our current understandings regarding contribution behavior in virtual communities, but also yields deep insights into how motivational mechanism of virtual communities can be reasonably designed and properly used to promote continuous contributions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Motivational mechanism; Prosocial motivation; Self-interest motivation; Status-standing; Virtual community","Behavioral research; Motivation; Virtual reality; Collective action; Community activities; Contribution behaviors; Motivation factors; Status-standing; Theoretical modeling; Virtual community; Social networking (online)"

The potential of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) is currently being explored by the financial sector and its implementation may affect the SEPA schemes in a variety of dimensions. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article was to determine the potential impact that the DLT transfer to the banking sector may have on the functioning of the SEPA in the future. The paper presents SEPA’s assumptions and the current status of the project as well as the DTL’s concept. It describes the technology transfer implications for the banking industry and compares the SEPA schemes currently operating with those based on the DLT. It also indicates the opportunities and threats that are the consequence of the new technology implementation and examines their significance for the SEPA. Methods: In the article, a qualitative analysis is supplemented with a quantitative one. Elements of descriptive statistics have been used to characterize the functioning of the main pillars of the SEPA schemes. The final conclusions are based on the comparative analysis of the SEPA schemes and developed DLT applications. Findings & Value added: The existing problems might be solved by supplementing the SEPA payment schemes currently operating with the applications based on the DLT. The systems that will be subsequently developed will provide the required real-time processing and a global reach. They will also extend the functionalities of the SEPA schemes with the ability to transfer other currencies. The implementation of this technology will result not only in new financial products but, first of all, in creating new business models. Consequently, we may expect a modification of the currently operating SEPA schemes, based on their supplementation rather than total replacement in a short time frame. © 2017, Institute of Economic Research.

Cryptocurrencies, when fully adopted by the general public, would transmit into the financial system via money demand. Cryptocurrencies serve as money and non-money assets and have no perfect substitute, whereas they are perfect substitutes for M1. Therefore, how much impact would the popularity of cryptocurrencies have on domestic and international capital mobility? To isolate interest rate differentials across countries, the Mundell-Fleming model that assumes a constant interest rate in domestic and world economies was applied. Cryptocurrencies acquired in past periods that are acceptable worldwide would abrogate exchange rate differentials. This study theoretically finds that fiscal and monetary policies would have different impacts on income in economies with high cryptocurrency circulations compared to economies with only M1. Also, there is a critical interest rate where cryptocurrencies would be more attractive to investors than other non-money assets. Moreover, using the Keynesian aggregate income and aggregate expenditure model, without interest and exchange rate differentials, the worldwide use of cryptocurrencies in international trade would unveil the link between the twin deficits and international capital flows. © 2021, International Atlantic Economic Society.","Capital mobility; Cryptocurrency; E40; E41; F31; F32; Liquidity preference; Money demand; Twin deficits",""

This paper builds on the neoclassical labor-leisure model to examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior, game provider's strategies, and social welfare. When the game provider offers virtual currency for sale, players have two options to obtain virtual currency-playing the game and purchasing virtual currency directly. We introduce a parameter-the enabling-power rate of virtual currency-to characterize the extent to which virtual currency generated in a unit of playing time can augment players' production of gaming leisure. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing time for certain heavy players, whereas it boosts certain light players' playing time. It may also lead to a larger player base allowing more people to enjoy the benefits of playing digital games when the enabling-power rate of virtual currency is sufficiently high. The game provider should charge a higher (lower) virtual currency price for a game with a relatively lower (higher) enabling-power rate of virtual currency. She should also set a higher (lower) ad level for a game with a relatively higher (lower) enabling-power rate if the game's base valuation of gameplay, that is, the valuation of gameplay independent of virtual currency, is sufficiently low. Finally, we demonstrate that selling virtual currency could lead to a win-win-win situation for the game provider, players, and society as a whole. It will alleviate the conflict of interest between the provider's goal of longer playing time to maximize her ad revenue fromin-game ads and the social goal of reducing excessive gaming, especially for heavy players. © 2019 INFORMS.","Digital games; Free-to-play games; In-game purchases; Social welfare; Virtual currency","Computer games; Interactive computer graphics; Purchasing; Sales; Conflict of interest; Digital games; Free to plays; New business models; Social goals; Social welfare; Virtual currency; Win-win-win; Electronic money"

Despite the public availability of DLT transactions, their cryptoasset holdings are not yet subject to systematic auditing procedures. In this paper, we propose an approach to assess the solvency of a VASP by cross-referencing data from three distinct sources: cryptoasset wallets, balance sheets, and supervisory entity data. We investigate 24 VASPs registered with the Financial Market Authority in Austria. Regulatory data insights show that their yearly incoming and outgoing transaction volume amounts to 2 billion EUR for 1.8 million customers; the financial services they provide position them closer to brokers, money exchanges, and funds, rather than banks. Next, we empirically measure DLT transaction flows of four VASPs and compare their cryptoasset holdings to balance sheet entries.

The relevance of the topic is due to the growing use of crypto-assets in the financial systems around the world in the absence of a unified interpretation and regulation of digital assets in the monetary and tax spheres. The aim of the study is to identify economic and legal approaches to the interpretation of crypto-assets and to determine the features of taxation of crypto-assets in Australia, United Kingdom, Singapore, Switzerland the USA and Japan. The study revealed the features of direct and indirect taxation of crypto-assets in developed countries. The study used methods of comparative analysis and synthesis. We studied the tax consequences of typical crypto-assets transactions such as: mining crypto-assets; acquisition of crypto-assets; the use of crypto-assets for payments of goods, works and services; implementation of crypto-assets acquired for investment purposes and etc. It is concluded that in the analyzed countries the interpretations of virtual currencies differ not only at the national level, but also at the level of regulatory authorities. The study did not establish correlation between taxation of crypto-assets and regulation of digital assets in the monetary systems. In most countries crypto-assets related incomes are taxable by corporate taxes and the burden of taxation is defined by domestic corporate taxation approach. At the same time in some countries the income of individuals is completely exempt from taxation. The authors concluded that tax incentives can help reduce speculative pressure and stimulate the wider use of crypto-assets by both institutional and private investors as a means of payment, means of savings and investment. The results of the study can be used by national regulatory authorities to create the optimal tax regime for crypto-assets transactions. The optimal tax regime for crypto-assets transactions should be aimed not maximizing budget revenues but the creation of favorable conditions for stimulating innovation in the field of digital assets both the national and international levels. © 2020 Publishing House of the Higher School of Economics.

The prediction relies mostly on the assessed condition of inspected segments, generally based on CCTV reports. However, several sources of uncertainty affect the condition assessment and may lead to inefficient maintenance. The present article focuses on three main questions. 1. What is the impact of uncertainty in assessed condition on the prediction model? 2. Considering uncertainties in the assessed condition, is it necessary to collect data on the characteristics of many segments, or are a small number of influential variables enough to build the condition prediction model? 3. Is it better to overestimate (false positive) or underestimate (false negative) the deterioration of a segment? These questions were evaluated on a semi-virtual asset stock and the results confirm that uncertainties affect the inspection efficiency negatively. Results also show that errors leading to the overestimation of the deterioration have less negative impact. The study suggests that data from a small number of influential segments is adequate to inform the prediction model. © 2019","Asset management; Condition assessment; Deterioration model; Sewer inspection program; Uncertainty","Asset management; Deterioration; Forecasting; Inspection; Sewers; Condition assessments; Condition prediction; Deterioration modeling; Inspection efficiency; Proactive maintenance program; Sewer inspection; Sources of uncertainty; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis"

Employing an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the research examines how perceived ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, interactivity, immersion, and virtual reward enhance students' active learning intention. Data collected from 414 students majoring in international business across two universities in China reveal that perceived ease of use and usefulness significantly influence interactivity, while virtual rewards impact immersion and playfulness, further influencing students' active learning intention. The study developed a new scale to measure active learning intention in TikTok usage, rigorously validating its reliability and validity through pre-testing and statistical analyses. Furthermore, the research uncovers the moderating role of novelty experience in the relationship between these factors and active learning intention. The findings offer significant implications for integrating emerging technologies like TikTok into management education, highlighting the need for pedagogical strategies that leverage the unique features of social media platforms for creating and sharing short videos to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. By providing empirical evidence and a discussion of the practical implications, this research contributes to advancing the understanding of digital pedagogies in management education and encourages exploring innovative teaching methods to promote management learning in the digital era. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Active learning intention; International business education; Management education; Short-form video; Social media in education; Technology acceptance model; TikTok",""

Customer disengagement may be caused by many factors, ad skepticism is one of them; ad skepticism has two main antecedents personality variable and consumption/influencing variables. This research explores the relationship of ad skepticism with customer disengagement through personality variables which are cynicism, reactance and self-esteem. The unit of analysis is the telecom and banking industry of Pakistan which is foreseeing an era of virtual currency and both are customer oriented industries. Only offline disengagement is researched and data is collected from the Business centers of telecom and banking branches dealing with virtual currency in Pakistan. Hypothetical model is given after digging the relevant literature; model is tested through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Eight hypotheses were purposed from the connections of model, all hypotheses are accepted except the cynicism positive effect on social ad skepticism. This can be due to commonality of social and charity in Pakistani society, Muslims consider charity as a pious act and they do not think for cynic behavior in charity or social related works. The results manifest that customers in telecom industry are having ad skepticism and that is becoming the cause of their disengagement. Further, social ad skepticism has more impact on the customer disengagement than the general ad skepticism. While the reactance has more effect on general ad skepticism than other antecedents and cynicism has the lowest impact on social ad skepticism than other antecedents. © 2017 Growing Science Ltd.

One emerging strategy to sell the premium module, known as the virtual selling strategy, is to set the module price based on an amount of virtual currency that players can either spend on playtime to earn or use real currency to buy. In this paper, we examine how the virtual selling strategy leads to different market outcomes than the traditional real selling strategy where players can purchase the premium module using real currency only. We focus on the differences caused by one specific feature—players can pay for the module indirectly using their playtime in the virtual selling strategy. We show that when the provider’s efficiency of monetizing players’ playtime, that is, the time revenue rate, is above a threshold, the virtual selling strategy will benefit the provider and hurt the overall consumer surplus compared with the real selling strategy, even though players in the virtual selling strategy have one additional way, that is, using their playtime, to pay for the module. We identify an undocumented overcompensation effect that causes the profit augmentation and the surplus reduction. The overcompensation effect also results in a U-shaped relationship between the equilibrium module price and the time revenue rate in the virtual selling strategy when the module only provides a small number of new gaming stages. It contradicts the traditional result from the real selling strategy that the provider shall reduce the module price when she becomes more efficient in monetizing players’ playtime.

Bitcoin, by far the most prominent cryptocurrency, currently trades around $9,500 USD. “Why is Bitcoin valuable?” is a question often heard but seldom answered well. It is not the legal tender of any nation, nor does it represent anything of physical or intrinsic value. Some people attribute its value to its scarcity, others to its anonymity, and others to its immutability, all of which are created and managed by a computer algorithm. Current theories fail to explain Bitcoin’s value, or it is not immediately apparent how they might explain it. We are therefore motivated to investigate the sources of cryptocurrency value through the emergent value systems of the Bitcoin community. We use concourse theory and Q-methodology to discover five types of Bitcoin value systems that are complementary and coexisting facets of a collective whole, each type being its own internally consistent “theory” of value, and therefore our typology avoids simplistic generalizations about cryptocurrencies and the motivations behind those involved. We named the types: Fintech, Libertarians, Purists, Average Joe, and Gentrifier. Of interest, four of the five types we identified appear not to value Bitcoin for its monetary or market value, despite what is usually assumed. Instead, Bitcoin is associated with its potential as an alternative currency that may be used to exchange value, to mitigate various forms of risk, or as a force for social and cultural change. These five types may also underlie broader digital innovation processes and provide a basis from which to understand them. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Abductive reasoning; Bitcoin; concourse theory; cryptocurrency; Q-methodology; Q-sort; subjective value; value; value systems; virtual currency",""

Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on the qualitative content analysis of 40 ICO statements issued by regulators in 37 countries by applying a custom-made coding table. Findings: The research shows that “soft law” is used predominantly by high-capacity jurisdictions. “Soft law” allows for more flexibility and less technological and business neutrality. The findings also show the contradiction between empirical evidence and public sentiment: it seems that the widespread notion that virtual currencies have connotations with money laundering/financing of terrorism (ML/FT) is not shared by the regulators, who are more concerned by the fraud. Finally, it was found that the standard-setting bodies are lagging behind in providing guidance on the emergence technologies. Research limitations/implications: The content analysis is based on 40 statements, which is a limited set of data. The method might be subject to interpersonal bias, although arrangements were made to ensure the uniformity of coding process. Practical implications: The findings imply that soft law is an attractive risk-mitigation tool when the object of regulation is still evolving but the risks are present. Soft law also might contradict with the “technology and business neutrality” principle which requires further research. Finally, the findings show the need for more active involvement of the standard setting bodies.
