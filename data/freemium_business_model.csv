Design/methodology/approach: Study of the various prospects of various digital business firms like revenues, customer base, share price, ranks. Uses of freemium business model to hold on to existing customers and attract new customers. Findings: Innovative service or product offerings and growth strategy is the base of this business model. So businesses must assess innovation strategy before deciding whether to opt the freemium business model or not. Retaining the existing user and constant addition of new users are the founding stone of the freemium business model. So, the value offerings have to be well perceived by the customer so that switching costs will be increased for them and the customer will remain loyal. Originality/value: Analyzing consumer behavior with recent analytical tools and techniques such as web analytics, bigdata analytics are required in order to get deeper market knowledge. It is crucial to get the knowledge of recent trends of markets, the perception of customer and customer’s journey mapping in order to run a business with freemium model. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

By taking a demand-side perspective, I argue that business models create and capture value when the elements that compose a business model improve how consumers perceive a firm's products and better enable heterogeneous consumers to act on their willingness-to-pay. I develop theory on how the freemium business model competes with the premium business model and test hypotheses in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played less and generate less revenues and that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with higher revenues. Managerial Summary: Freemium business models are increasingly prevalent in the digital economy, yet very little is known about how freemium affects consumers' perceptions of value and their willingness-to-pay. In this article, I study how the freemium business model competes with the premium business model in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played less and generate less revenues than premium games and that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with higher revenues. This implies that in order to achieve competitive parity with firms operating the premium business model, firms operating the freemium business model need to create more value (e.g., through improved product quality, income from advertisements, or unlocking network externalities) or operate at lower costs.

By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intramarket competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products.

On the one hand, social referral programs generate new referrals from users who would not have paid for the premium features. On the other hand, they also attract new referrals from users who would have paid but prefer to invite others, resulting in more referrals but fewer paying users. We use data from a large-scale randomized field experiment in an online dating platform to assess the effects of adding referrals programs to freemium platforms and changing the referral requirements on users’ behavior, namely, on their decisions to invite, pay, and engage with the platform. We find that introducing referral programs in freemium platforms can significantly contribute to increasing the number of referrals at the expense of revenue. Platforms can avoid the loss in revenue by reserving some premium features exclusively for paying users. We also find that increasing referral requirements in social referral programs can work as a double-edged sword. Increasing the referral threshold results in more referrals and higher total revenue. Yet these benefits appear to come at a cost. Users become less engaged, decreasing the value of the platform for all users. We explore two mechanisms that help to explain the differences in users’ social engagement. Finally, and contrary to prior findings, we find that the quality of the referrals is not affected by the referral requirements. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our research.

In particular, we focus on two emerging software business models that involve a free component: feature-limited freemium (FLF) and uniform seeding (S). Under FLF, the firm offers the basic software version for free, while charging for premium features. Under S, the firm gives away for free the full product to a percentage of the addressable market uniformly across consumer types. We benchmark their performance against a conventional business model under which software is sold as a bundle (labeled as ""charge for everything"" or CE) without free offers. In the context of consumer bounded rationality and information asymmetry, we develop a unified two-period consumer valuation learning framework that accounts for both word-of-mouth (WOM) effects and experience-based learning, and use it to compare and contrast the three business models. Under both constant and dynamic pricing, for moderate strength of WOM signals, we derive the equilibria for each model and identify optimality regions. In particular, S is optimal when consumers significantly underestimate the value of functionality and cross-module synergies are weak. When either cross-module synergies are stronger or initial priors are higher, the firm decides between CE and FLF. Furthermore, we identify nontrivial switching dynamics from one optimality region to another depending on the initial consumer beliefs about the value of the embedded functionality. For example, there are regions where, ceteris paribus, FLF is optimal when the prior on premium functionality is either relatively low or high, but not in between. We also demonstrate the robustness of our findings with respect to various parameterizations of cross-module synergies, strength of WOM effects, and number of periods. We find that stronger WOM effects or more periods lead to an expansion of the seeding optimality region in parallel with a decrease in the seeding ratio. Moreover, under CE and dynamic pricing, second period price may be decreasing in the initial consumer valuation beliefs when WOM effects are strong and the prior is relatively low. However, this is not the case under weak WOM effects. We also discuss regions where price skimming and penetration pricing are optimal. Our results provide key managerial insights that are useful to firms in their business model search and implementation. © 2014 INFORMS."

The authors propose an agent-based framework that aggregates social network-level individual interactions to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1 ) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies. © 2017, American Marketing Association."

However, the key challenge of these models is transitioning participants from free users to paying consumers. To encourage paid consumption, companies often rely on product differentiation such as providing consumers who pay for products or services with enhanced features. However, limited research has addressed how such product differentiation may convert consumers from ""free""to ""fee.""Our research examines the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game as a compelling example of a freemium platform-based business model. We contribute to the freemium literature by introducing three new MOBA-specific differentiations-character competency, character variety, and character-appearance differentiation. We also extend consumption values theory into a dual-path model to unveil the underlying mechanisms through which product differentiation influences in-game purchase. We empirically validate our dual-pathmodel using data froma two-wave longitudinal experiment and three cross-sectional experiments. Our findings support opposing mediating paths for product differentiation in character competency and variety and indicate that these two types of differentiation can indeed undermine perceived game fairness. Conversely, character-appearance differentiation exerts only a positive influence on players' purchasing of in-game items. Consequently, the findings of this study have important potential implications for platform-based companies leveraging freemiumbusinessmodels that seek to increase their share of paying customers.  © 2022 INFORMS."

In addition, we provide guidelines for the firm on the conditions of introducing a freemium model. Our results reveal that the firm earns a growing profit by ratcheting up the premium price as the intensity of snobbery increases beyond a certain threshold, and in mild configurations, the firm earns a higher profit if it increases value discrepancy between the free and premium versions.

Nevertheless, companies have to think about fee-based business models online to deal with changing environmental conditions (e.g., online newspaper providers). One way to earn money in a digital environment is a price introduction for content that was previously provided free of charge. When companies change their business model from free to paid content—also known as “free-to-fee switch”—it is generally an unexpected transition for customers; consequently, their willingness to pay is often low due to consumers’ “for free” mentality regarding content on the Internet (Sjøvaag 2015). In this regard, the manner of free-to-fee switches as well as the characteristics of the business model after the price is introduced (e.g., design of a preview version) are essential for companies’ success. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation is to fill the gap in the scholarly literature about price introductions by providing a better understanding of customers’ reactions and ways of minimizing their negative consequences and by showing how to use different preview characteristics after a free-to-fee switch. Moreover, this dissertation gains important insights for companies planning a free-to-fee switch or having experienced a switch in the past. In order to attain this purpose, this dissertation covers (1) the fundamental mechanisms of unexpected free-to-fee switches, (2) different forms of free-to-fee switches, and (3) previews for online newspaper providers that were affected by free-to-fee switches. This dissertation thus consists of three individual papers. To summarize, the first paper provides evidence for the negative effects of free-to-fee switches, which can be minimized by justifying the switch. Paper 2 extends this knowledge by considering the possibility of a freemium switch. However, the improvement in attitudes caused by providing an additional free version is accompanied by a decrease in purchase intents. Paper 3 focuses on preview characteristics in freemium business models and illustrates that an interrupted preview ending (vs. a concluded one) is inferior for commercial text-based content. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science."

Prior studies have noted the differences between strong-tie and weak-tie influences but have yet to examine the underlying mechanisms of these two kinds of peer influences. Hence, this study compared the influences of strong-tie versus weak-tie peers and investigated their influencing mechanisms by proposing two mediating variables (envy regarding the outcomes of peers and conformity to peer choices) in the context of non-functional item consumption in free-to-play mobile games. This study further unveiled how these variables’ mediation of peer influence channels through envy and conformity are adjusted by tie strength and individual differences, as well as their interactions. The model was tested using a scenario-based experiment that integrated the essence of field surveys and lab experiments. This study enriches theory by distinguishing the underlying mechanisms between strong- and weak-tie peer influences.

Adopting a generalized version of the screening framework, we ask when and why a firm should endogenously offer a zero price on its low-end product when users’ product usages generate network externalities on each other. In the standard screening framework without network effects, freemium never emerges as optimal, and the firm always chooses the efficient price point for its low-end product. We show that even with network effects, freemium is typically not optimal. When network effects are identical across products (“symmetric”), the firm has greater incentive to expand its network size and may find it profitable to sell to the low-end customers. However, this does not lead to freemium as an equilibrium strategy. Instead, the firm should offer a low-end product to attract customers, while keeping its price positive. Freemium can only emerge if the high-and low-end products provide different levels of (“asymmetric”) marginal network effects. In other words, the firm would set a zero price for its low-end product only if the high-end product provided larger utility gain from an expansion of the firm’s user base. In contrast to conventional beliefs, a firm pursuing the freemium strategy might increase the baseline quality on its low-end product above the “efficient” level, which seemingly reduces differentiation. © 2019 INFORMS."
