This research examines a lab experiment to test six hypotheses. Results indicate that perceived proximity to virtual products enhances perceived measurement feedback and, thereby, perceived generality. In addition, perceived generality fully mediates the effect of perceived measurement feedback on perceived purchase intention in the near future when consumers interact with non-augmented reality applications. In contrast, perceived measurement feedback directly influences perceived purchase intention in the near future in AR applications. Furthermore, the absence of product in consumers’ consideration set dilutes the effect of perceived generality on perceived purchase intention in the near future when consumers interact with non-augmented reality application. This study suggests several managerial implications for AR developers and online retail managers. © 2021 The Author(s)"

Drawing on construal level theory and the sunk costs fallacy, we examine how psychological distance and prior investments in information search influence service consumers’ reactions to negative eWOM. We find that when consumers perceive the service consumption to be psychologically proximal, temporal investments in information search diminish the impact of negative eWOM on behavioral intentions. This effect is so robust that even a highly negative forum consensus does not mitigate it. Conversely, when the consumption experience is perceived as distal, temporal investments fail to buffer the impact of negative eWOM, and a forum consensus magnifies the impact. Our findings have important implications for service firms, as service consumers may make many of their evaluations and decisions under the influence of psychological distance and sunk costs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

Although past research has explored the relationship between psychological distance, construal and consumer evaluation, the effects of various dimensions of distance have only been considered in isolation. Our research contributes to past work by testing the effects of experiencing two dimensions of psychological distance simultaneously on construal and consumer evaluations.

Focusing on the asymmetric distance from a gift that exists within giver-receiver dyads, the authors propose that, unlike receivers, givers construe gifts abstractly and therefore weight desirability attributes more than feasibility attributes. Support for this proposition emerges in studies examining giver and receiver mind-sets, as well as giver and receiver evaluations of gifts. Furthermore, givers do not choose gifts that maximize receiver happiness or other relationship goals even though givers believe they are doing so. Finally, the authors demonstrate that while givers are sensitive to their distance from the receiver, receivers are not sensitive to this distance. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc."

This study examines how the two prevalent price promotion strategies affect online review ratings differently as a function of the temporal distance between purchase and review. Drawing upon the framing literature and construal level theory, we argue that whereas free shipping should increase review ratings regardless of temporal distance, coupons should increase review ratings through perceptions of monetary savings when temporal distance is close but decrease review ratings through low perceive product quality when temporal distance is far. Consistent with this argument, our analysis of online consumer reviews from an e-commerce website matched with actual transactional data finds that coupons have a positive effect on review ratings in the short run but a negative effect in the long run. In contrast, free shipping has a consistently positive effect on review ratings over time. A text-mining analysis of the review contents reveals patterns that are consistent with the proposed underlying mechanisms. We then conduct two laboratory experiments that manipulate temporal distance and construal level respectively with real spending and consumptions to provide convergent evidence for the differential effects of coupon versus free shipping on review ratings over time and additionally demonstrate the underlying processes due to perceptions of monetary savings and perceived product quality. © 2021 INFORMS"

Three studies using mixed methods and diverse samples show that informational variables vary in their capacity to evoke telepresence and thus in their impact on consumer behavioral intention. Study 1, a content analysis, uses expert judges and a global pool of virtual servicescapes to provide initial evidence that informational variables impact telepresence. Study 2, a commercial survey, shows that telepresence mediates effects of mystery and complexity (sensorially richer variables) on consumer intentions to approach. Study 3 uses a consumer sample to replicate the mediating role of telepresence and to show that a person’s visual processing style moderates effects of mystery and complexity. The effects are robust in the presence of an alternative process path through aesthetics and occur regardless of consumers’ familiarity with the servicescape, category knowledge, and involvement. Managerial implications focus on how to increase mystery and complexity for higher telepresence. © The Author(s) 2018."

Such practices are difficult to identify given they exist in the informal economy, and involve vulnerable individuals. Addressing modern slavery by organizations requires awareness of its context and complexities. While corporations have increasingly sought to manage modern slavery risk in their supply chains, their understanding of what modern slavery is and what should be managed remains limited. We argue a key problem with firms’ efforts to manage modern slavery risk is that it is a psychologically distant concept for them. We apply construal level theory to explore how organizations’ psychological distance from modern slavery risk affects their management of risk. We interviewed purchasing executives at 41 global organizations in Australia, Finland, and the U.S and identified four approaches to managing modern slavery risk at different levels of psychological distance. We also identified that conflicts between organizations' approaches to risk and what they identify in their operating environment, precedes important construal shifts that help to improve organizational understanding of labor-related risk. We highlight ways that organizations' understanding of modern slavery risk plays a role in their governance of such risk in supply chains. © 2021 The Authors.

In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages. © 2013, American Marketing Association."

Australian residents (N = 333) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: one framed to increase psychological distance to climate change (distal frame), and the other framed to reduce psychological distance (proximal frame). Participants then completed measures of psychological distance of climate change impacts, climate change concern, and intentions to engage in mitigation behavior. Principal components analysis indicated that psychological distance to climate change was best conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four components: geographic, temporal, social, and uncertainty.

While theoretical frameworks like construal-level theory and the “Not in My Backyard” (or NIMBY) moniker provide insight into these spatial dynamics, case studies in specific locations experiencing energy development reveal substantial variation in community responses. Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity—respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent’s location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice. When significant, these relationships are similar to or exceed the effects of race, income, gender, and age. We discuss the implications of these findings for effective risk communication as well as the importance of incorporating spatial analysis into public opinion research on perceptions of energy development. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis."

Results suggest that attribute framing is most effective when there is congruence between the construal level evoked in a frame and the evaluator's psychological distance from the framed event. A follow-up experiment confirms that the congruence between a frame's construal level and psychological distance-not simply its valence-appears to be driving attribute framing effects.

On some occasions, it causes employees to view their work as more meaningful. At other times, it causes them to become dispirited. These inconsistent findings may in part be explained by a paradox: the very features that make ultimate aspirations meaningful—their breadth and timelessness—undermine the ability of employees to see how their daily responsibilities are associated with them. To understand how leaders can help employees resolve this paradox, I analyzed archival evidence to explore the actions of President John F. Kennedy when leading NASA in the 1960s. I found that Kennedy enacted four sensegiving steps, each of which helped employees see a stronger connection between their work and NASA’s ultimate aspirations. When this connection was strongest, employees construed their day-to-day work not as short-term tasks (“I’m building electrical circuits”) but as the pursuit of NASA’s long-term objective (“I’m putting a man on the moon”) and the aspiration this objective symbolized (“I’m advancing science”).

Drawing on construal level theory, we propose that consumers' reliance on base rate (case information) will be enhanced (weakened) by psychological distance. A corollary of this premise is that self-positivity (i.e., underestimating self-risk vs. other-risk) is likely when the disease base rate is high but the case information suggests low risk. In contrast, self-negativity (i.e., overestimating self-risk vs. other-risk) is likely when the disease base rate is low, but case information implies high risk. Six experiments provide convergent support for this thesis, using different operationalizations of construal level, base rate, and case risk across multiple health domains.

In the setting of medical Q&A sites, we propose a novel content-context congruence perspective with a focus on the role of congruence between an answer's content and the answer's contextual cues.

For instance, potential performance benefits of EVs might offset range limitations for consumers who have such direct experience. The effect of direct experience was tested in a randomised controlled trial with 393 mass-market consumer drivers. An experimental group were given direct experience of a modern battery electric vehicle (BEV), and a control group an equivalent conventional car. Despite rating the performance of the BEV more highly than that of the conventional car, willingness to consider a BEV declined after experience, particularly if the range of the BEV considered was short.

Construal-level theory describes how the same event can be interpreted in different ways, thus influencing the type of information people pay attention to, how they process that information, and their resulting decisions and actions. Our theoretical framework explores the dynamic nature of construal levels by developing two new constructs: construal shifts and construal flexibility. In doing so we draw on self-regulation research to detail how executives can develop the capacity to modify how they process information to best meet changing situational demands.

Design/methodology/approach: First, in a survey setting, the study identifies the relationship between temporal focus and self-congruence. Subsequently, we conduct three experiments to capture the effects of temporal focus on brand preference and willingness to pay (WTP). In these experiments, we manipulate consumers’ self-congruence and temporal focus. Findings: The findings show that consumers with a present focus (distant future and distant past foci) tend to evaluate a brand more preferably when the brand serves to reflect their actual (ideal) selves. However, in the absence of present focus consumers’ WTP is more for a brand that reflects their ideal selves. Research limitations/implications: The study does not have an actual measure on consumers’ WTP; instead we use single-item measure. Practical implications: This study sheds new light on branding strategy. The results suggest that authentic and aspirational branding strategies are relevant to publicly consumed products. Brand managers could incorporate consumers’ temporal focus into branding strategy that could significantly influence consumer preference and WTP for their brands.

Based on construal level theory, we propose that higher social distance will lead to more severe evaluations of immoral behavior and therefore entail lower ethical leadership ratings. More-over, we hypothesize that ethical leadership will positively affect LMX. Participants read a scenario describing a moral situation in which a leader, who was presented in either high or low social distance, behaves unethically toward an employee. We tested our predictions using a structural equation modeling approach. As expected, participants in the high social distance condition judged leaders more harshly (i. e., they gave lower ethical leadership ratings) than in the low social distance condition. Thus, social distance moderated the extent to which leaders are perceived as ethical leaders after moral transgression. Moreover, in accordance with our proposition, ethical leadership ratings had a positive influence on LMX. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Specifically, we theorize that the congruency between idea framing and audiences' mental construals depends on audiences' level of expertise in evaluating novel ideas. In four experiments, we found that innovators benefit from deploying framing strategies congruent with audiences' mental construals: novices (e.g., lay people, crowdfunders) appreciate more novel ideas framed in abstract why terms, while experts (e.g., professional investors, innovation managers) novel ideas framed in concrete how terms. Integrating the strategic framing of novel ideas with construal level theory and audience heterogeneity contributes to research on entrepreneurship, innovation, and impression management. Managerial Summary: One of the critical challenges that innovators (e.g., entrepreneurs) face is to persuade relevant audiences (e.g., users, crowdfunders, professional investors, and innovation managers) to support their novel ideas. This article integrates various literatures concerned with the evaluation of novelty to examine the impact of different framing strategies on the reception of novel ideas by different audiences. By demonstrating that the framing of a novel business idea affects audience members' evaluation, and that the effectiveness of different frames (why vs. how) varies with the target audiences (novices vs. experts), we offer actionable insights into how innovators can strategically use linguistic framing to increase the likelihood of eliciting favorable evaluations and resource commitment for their ideas. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The experimental results reveal interesting insights. First, when the temporal cue indicates near distance, concrete product review content is perceived as more helpful. By contrast, abstract review content is perceived as more helpful when the temporal cue is distant. Second, social cues are non-instrumental in affecting the evaluation of concrete product review content; however, near social cues have bearings on the evaluation of abstract product review content.

In contrast, efficacy perception related to the perceived feasibility of attaining end-state goals should influence engagement at closer distance. Results from an experimental survey based on a national sample that is both demographically and geographically representative (N = 1,282) supported our proposition. At closer spatial distance, perceived efficacy boosted by efficacy framing increased participants’ intention to perform climate mitigation behaviors. In contrast, at farther distance, risk framing increased behavioral intention through heightened risk perception.

Trope, Liberman, and Wakslak (2007) provide a review of this literature. In this commentary, we illustrate the relevance of construal-level theory to issues in consumer psychology, particularly consumer decision making. We highlight specific questions that researchers could address by considering consumer behavior within the framework of changes in construal. We focus our discussion on how construal levels affect consideration sets and how shifts in weight from high-level to low-level features might lead to consumer regret and dissatisfaction. Construal level can help us understand follow-through on stated intentions for ""really new"" products and illuminate public-policy issues such as consumer saving for retirement and nonredemption of rebates. We identify open issues related to how construal levels for the same object evolve over time and whether resources differ in terms of how susceptible they are to psychological distance effects.

They find evidence of a fluency-driven matching effect in online search such that when consumer mindsets are more abstract (more concrete), consumers generate textual search queries that use more abstract (more concrete) language. Furthermore, they are more likely to click on search engine results and ad content that matches their mindset, thereby experiencing more search satisfaction and perceiving greater goal progress.

Such distances directly affect individual behavior and shape other features of the context that alter groupprocesses (e.g., by forcing groups to adopt new communication tools). Prior research has examined isolated effects ofvarious dimensions of virtuality without considering how these effects on individual behavior and group dynamics mighthave conceptually related underpinnings. To address this gap, we propose an extension of construal-level theory as a wayto link the effects of virtuality through a common mediating mechanism. According to construal-level theory, events orobjects that are physically or temporally distant are also distant psychologically and thus are likely to be described interms of their general characteristics. In contrast, views of more proximal events or objects will be more detailed andnuanced. We develop propositions that illustrate how objective dimensions of distance create psychological distance andhow that in turn affects how individuals view and interact with their teammates. We also develop propositions that showhow the context of the distributed group (e.g., technology usage) affects this process over time. We compare and link thisconstrual-based approach to alternatives based in theories of computer-mediated communication and social identity, and wethereby show that construal-level theory offers both parsimonious explanations and novel predictions about how and whydistance alters perceptions of distributed group members (including oneself).

We posit that this general skepticism towards CSR leads people to adopt a low-level construal mindset when processing CSR information. Across four studies, we show that matching this low-level mindset with concrete CSR messaging works to effectively mitigate the negative effects of inherent CSR skepticism on consumers’ attitudes, purchase intentions, and word of mouth. The resulting construal-mindset congruency strengthens the favorability of consumer responses through increased positive elaboration and perceptions of CSR message credibility. Furthermore, this congruency effect is shown to persist over time in skeptical domains but to dissipate in less skeptical domains. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

In this study, we take a hedonic approach to well-being and challenge the consensus that surface acting is bad for employees by examining its effects on changes in emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction, through changes in positive and negative affect, for both positive and negative emotional displays. Using a within-person approach, we focus on managers, whose occupation calls for displays of both positive and negative emotions. Our 3-week, experience-sampling study of 79 managers revealed that faking positive emotions decreases positive affect, which harms well-being more than authentically displaying such emotions. In contrast and counter to what the extant literature would suggest, faking negative emotions decreases negative affect and increases positive affect, which benefits well-being more than authentically displaying such emotions.

To cast light on this issue, the current research investigated the interactive effects of exposure to online previews and reviews on individual purchase decisions. We analyzed a unique two-month panel data set on 270,260 sessions that comprise clickstream data on consumers’ exposure to previews and reviews and data on their subsequent purchase behaviors. On the basis of analyses underlain by a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that online previews positively influence individual purchase decisions. More importantly, significant interactions exist between previews and reviews, as evidenced by the decreasing positive effect of previews with increasing review volume and average review rating. In addition, previews can complement reviews when a high variance in the latter renders purchase decisions difficult. We further examined the sequence effect of exposure to previews and reviews and discovered that exposure to previews following the experience of reviews may exert a considerable positive influence on individual purchase decisions. The results from an additional field experiment and a text-based sentiment analysis reinforced the validity of our main findings by mitigating concerns regarding the endogeneity and the accuracy of the review quality, respectively.

This article examines the role of psychological distance (temporal and geographical) in consumers' assortment size decisions and rectifies contradicting hypotheses produced by construal level theory. Six studies demonstrate that while consumers prefer larger assortments when the choice takes place in the here and now, they are more likely to prefer small assortments when choices pertain to distant locations and times. This decrease in preference for large assortments is due to psychological distance increasing the similarity of the options in a category, making them appear more substitutable. This effect of psychological distance reverses when consumers consider desirability/feasibility trade-off information inherent in the assortment size decision. These findings point to important outcomes of psychological distance, resolving opposing predictions of construal level theory, and identify boundary conditions for the well-established notion that consumers are attracted to large assortments."

Recently, however, interaction designs that focus on communicating abstract consumer needs have been suggested as a promising alternative. This paper investigates how temporal distance moderates the effectiveness of these two competing IDA communication designs by its effect on consumers' mental representation of the product decision problem. Temporal distance is inherently connected to IDAs in two ways. Congruency between consumption timing (immediate versus distant) and IDA communication design (concrete versus abstract, respectively) increases the likelihood to accept the IDA's advice. This effect is also achieved by congruency between IDA process timing (immediate versus delayed delivery of recommendations) and IDA communication design (concrete versus abstract, respectively). We further show that this process is mediated by the perceived transparency of the IDA process. Managers and researchers need to take into account the importance of congruency between the user and the interface through which companies interact with their users and can further optimize IDAs so that they better match consumers' mental representations. © 2011 M.E.

We conduct two experiments and a field study to show that the amount of time elapsed between a service consumption experience and its evaluation influences satisfaction judgments. We show that consumers rely on concrete attributes to represent near-past (NP) experiences and on abstract attributes to represent distant-past (DP) experiences (i.e., different construal levels). The findings indicate that construal mechanisms generate intertemporal shifts in the importance of the attributes driving satisfaction over time (Study 1), in the weights assigned to abstract and concrete attributes of a past service experience (Study 2), and in overall satisfaction judgments when abstract and concrete attributes perform differently (Study 3). Overall, the results provide support for the idea that satisfaction judgments shift over time as a result of the different psychological mechanisms that are activated as a function of the time elapsing between the service experience and its evaluation. Managers are advised to adopt longitudinal approaches to customer satisfaction measurement: An immediate assessment to capture customers’ evaluations of the performance of the concrete details of the experience and a delayed assessment to measure customer satisfaction with more abstract and goal-related features of the experience. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015."

To encourage individuals to engage in and learn about secure behaviors, ISec research has turned to fear appeals, which are short messages that communicate threats and efficacy to elicit protection motivation among recipients. ISec research has reported contradictory findings on what makes fear appeals effective in ISec contexts, and this lack of clarity is problematic, because it may lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, some studies have argued that the mixed findings arise from differences between personal and organizational contexts and that fear appeals do not work well among organizational users. However, this argument has not been empirically tested, and differences in message design provide an equally plausible explanation, which has also not been tested. To reconcile the mixed findings across these studies, we test the effects of context (i.e., personal users vs. organizational users) and degree of message abstractness (i.e., abstract vs. concrete) on fear-appeal outcomes. We draw from construal-level theory to conceptualize the differences between abstract and concrete fear appeals. Across three experiments, we find evidence that concrete fear appeals are more effective than abstract fear appeals for the purpose of stimulating fear-appeal outcomes. Furthermore, by comparing two identical experiments—one conducted with personal users and another conducted with organizational users—we find differences in participants’ responses to fear appeals. However, contrary to our expectations, our findings suggest that organizational users report higher levels of fear and protection motivation than personal users. This finding is not a theoretical contradiction: the theoretical crux of an effective fear appeal is that it must be personally relevant to stimulate fear; correspondingly, we show that concrete fear appeals help stimulate fear and the desired protective response. Moreover, concrete fear appeals increase actual compliance behaviors, not just intentions. Thus, our findings suggest that the mixed findings in the literature may be a product of message abstractness and differences among audiences. This has pivotal implications for how to construct fear appeals in research and practice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Idea generation is an essential starting point for both types of innovation. Therefore, this study investigates whether ambidextrous idea generation, defined as the capability to actively generate both incremental and radical ideas, affects new product development (NPD) success. Analyses on the Comparative Performance Assessment Study (CPAS) data, which includes data from 453 companies distributed over 24 countries, demonstrate that ambidextrous idea generation does indeed affect NPD program success. Consequently, this study also investigates which antecedents foster ambidextrous idea generation. The innovation paradox concept predicts that achieving ambidexterity requires overcoming paradoxical antecedents. Therefore, we tested whether combinations of financial and breakthrough orientations (the paradox of strategic emphasis), a formal innovation process and an innovation culture (the paradox of innovation drivers), tight and loose customer coupling (the paradox of customer orientation), and internal development and external collaboration (the paradox of openness) affects ambidextrous idea generation. The results show that only customer orientation and openness have the expected inverted u-shaped effect. These finding are in line with construal level theory, which predicts that the organizational characteristics that influence idea-generation activity must be at the same construal level to have the desired effect. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, the analyses indicate that ambidextrous idea generation has significant repercussions for the entire NPD program. Second, the results show that resolving innovation paradoxes only has an effect if the construal level of the paradox and the activity match.

Examples of such virtual spaces are online policy deliberation forums (OPDFs) initiated by government organizations to garner citizens' views on policy issues. Incorporating the inputs from these forums can result in more inclusive policies for societal benefit. Yet, as with other such forums, a common issue facing OPDFs is the sustainability of participation. When examining this issue, previous research has mostly explored the participation antecedents of existing contributors. However, engaging lurkers is also important, because these forums need to compensate for contributor attrition and become more effective with greater reach. Thus motivated, this study develops a model to explain the antecedents of both contributors' and lurkers' participation deriving from public participation and information technology-enabled public goods theories. It hypothesizes differences in the antecedents for contributors versus lurkers based primarily on construal level theory. The model was empirically validated through a survey of contributors and lurkers in a nationwide OPDF. The results reveal significant differences in the participation antecedents of the two groups as hypothesized. Specifically, contributors are influenced by political career benefit and political efficacy motives, whereas lurkers' future participation intention is driven by collective benefits, possession of civic skills, and mobilization. Furthermore, perceived connectivity of the OPDF directly influences participation intention for contributors and indirectly impacts participation intention for both groups via perceived communality. Perceived communality, on the other hand, influences collective and persuasion benefits for both contributors and lurkers. These findings are useful for understanding and promoting participation through differential strategies for contributors and lurkers in OPDFs in particular, and by extension, other feedback or online forums. © 2015 INFORMS."

This study further considers a mechanism underlying the interaction between green messages and environmental consciousness on brand attitude with the perceived effectiveness of green products. The results show that when environmentally conscious individuals are exposed to abstract and distant temporal messages, they will report greater perceptions of a green product’s effectiveness and brand attitude than for concrete and proximal temporal messages. In contrast, less environmentally conscious respondents will not have different responses to the abstract/concrete and distant/proximal temporal messages.

We applied this idea to the risk context and explored the influence of construal level (CL) on the overestimation of small and underestimation of large probabilities for risk estimates concerning a vague target person (Study 1 and Study 3) and personal risk estimates (Study 2). We were specifically interested in whether the often-found overestimation of small probabilities could be reduced with abstract thinking, and the often-found underestimation of large probabilities was reduced with concrete thinking. The results showed that CL influenced risk estimates. In particular, a concrete mindset led to higher risk estimates compared to an abstract mindset for several adverse events, including events with small and large probabilities. This suggests that CL manipulation can indeed be used for improving the accuracy of lay people's estimates of small and large probabilities. Moreover, the results suggest that professional risk managers' risk estimates of common events (thus with a relatively high probability) could be improved by adopting a concrete mindset. However, the abstract manipulation did not lead managers to estimate extremely unlikely events more accurately.

Results showed that management commitment to safety positively relates to safety compliance and safety participation, while safety communication and feedback positively relates to safety participation. Furthermore, the consideration of future safety consequences was found to moderate the relationships between safety communication and feedback, and safety participation. Nevertheless, in the context of management commitment to safety and safety participation, the direction of the moderation was not as hypothesized. The research provides empirical evidence in support of the consideration of future safety consequences as a moderator. This contributes to the utility of self-efficacy theory, field theory, and construal level theory.

Furthermore, this research also examines how lay theories impact the effects of pride on construal levels and how power moderates the effect of hubristic versus authentic pride on product preferences varying in construal levels. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on cognitive appraisal and construal level theories, this research conducts eight experimental studies to test the hypotheses with an ANOVA, bootstrap analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. The details of the experiments are presented in the paper. Findings: The results show that people feeling authentic (hubristic) pride dominantly adopt a lower (higher) level of construal, and consequently put more weight on feasibility over desirability (desirability over feasibility) attributes. Authentic pride’s inclination to appeal behavior-specific appraisals triggers local appraisal tendencies and bestows lower construal levels, whereas hubristic pride’s inclination to connect the entire self triggers global appraisal tendencies and confers higher construal levels. Incremental (vs entity) theorists are likely to attribute the pride experience to their efforts (traits), and thus feel authentic (hubristic) pride. Furthermore, the product preferences of people experiencing authentic vs hubristic pride depend on their power state. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding the importance of this research, it is worthwhile to note some of its limitations to encourage future research. First, eight studies in the lab were conducted, but no real behavior study was conducted. Although there is a high correlation between the results of lab studies and those of real behavior studies, the authors encourage future researches to elicit the consumers’ pride in the actual consumption situation using a real behavior study. Furthermore, this research mainly focuses on pride, and does not examine other positive emotions, e.g. happiness. Therefore, the authors encourage future research to examine other positive emotions. Practical implications: The findings suggest that it is appropriate to use construal levels to match consumers’ pride types. In fact, marketers can induce hubristic pride or authentic pride in ads by simply using words or sentences (“feeling proud because of your hard work” or “feeling proud, you are so superior and remarkably unique”), and present either higher- or lower-level construal of desired behaviors to improve advertising effects. Originality/value: The research contributes to literature by documenting how hubristic/authentic pride can affect distinct construal levels via activating global/local appraisal tendencies. And this research thoroughly illustrates the mechanism by which hubristic/authentic pride activates global versus local appraisal tendencies. More importantly, this research finds how lay theories affect construal level given a pride experience and it also corroborates the moderating effects of power in the proposed relationship, which establish the boundary conditions of the effects of prides on construal levels. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We draw on construal level theory (CLT) to offer a fresh theoretical perspective on IT project risk management as it is uniquely suited to understanding why IT PMs may focus on the forest (abstract, high-level construal) or the trees (concrete, low-level construal). Specifically, we integrate CLT with IT project risk management and theorize how IT PMs’ mental construal affects four key IT project risk management activities: (1) risk identification, (2) risk impact assessment, (3) risk response planning, and (4) risk response enactment. We recruited a total of 805 IT PMs for this research and conducted a series of four laboratory experiments. In our experiments, we found that seeing the trees is beneficial in risk identification, risk impact assessment, and risk response planning. Specifically, we found that a concrete (relative to abstract) mental construal of a project leads IT PMs to identify a greater number of risks associated with the project (Experiment 1), and a concrete (relative to abstract) mental construal of a project risk leads IT PMs to perceive a greater potential impact of the risk (Experiment 2) and to perceive that more effort and resources are required for responding to the risk (Experiment 3). In contrast, we found that seeing the forest is beneficial in risk response enactment in that an abstract (relative to concrete) mental construal of a risk response leads IT PMs to be more willing to enact the risk response (Experiment 4).

The results of two studies suggest that the degree to which managers make high-risk tradeoffs is highly influenced by how they mentally represent the decision context. The authors find that managers are more likely to make seemingly unethical tradeoffs when psychological distance is high (rather than low) and when they are forced to choose between competing alternatives. However, when given the option not to choose, managers better reflect on the consequences of each alternative, and thus become more likely to choose options with less risk of negative consequences.

Although it is possible to select the ideal order quantity given the costs of over and undersupplying demand, prior research demonstrates that decision-makers consistently make suboptimal inventory choices. Drawing on construal level theory and psychological distance, this paper explores how differences in the spatial distance (suppliers that are geographically near or far) and temporal distance (short or long lead time from order to receipt) impact newsvendor decision-making. Across four experiments (N = 663), we find that a far psychological distance increases order quantities, which improves performance for high-margin products but results in added costs for low-margin goods. Given that spatial and temporal distances occur naturally in supply chains, our research shows that psychological distance is a cognitive explanation for biased inventory ordering and can be applied to improve decision-making. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society."

This research suggests that accountants, because of frequent financial priming, may be prone to overlooking unethical acts. Construal level theory research further suggests that psychologically distant events (also common in accounting) may exacerbate financial priming's effects. Across three experiments, we explore the interactive effect of financial priming, psychological distance, and financial reporting responsibility on recognition of financial misreporting as an ethical issue. Consistent with past research, we find that financially (versus neutrally) primed businesspeople without prior financial reporting responsibility are less likely to recognize psychologically distant financial misreporting as an ethical issue. Importantly, however, we find that financially (versus neutrally) primed accountants and other business professionals with financial reporting responsibility consider psychologically distant financial misreporting to be more unethical.

In order to effectively communicate information about products, various product presentation formats have been developed (e.g., 3D views, 360-degree rotatable views, and enlarged pictures). This study focuses on the usage of exploded view in digital product presentation. Exploded view clearly shows what technical components are included in a product, where these components are positioned, and how these technical components are assembled. Seeing internal components could facilitate consumers processing of product function and attributes, but it might be overwhelming for consumer processing. To understand how exploded view influences consumer processing, this study investigates the influence of product function description (concrete vs. abstract) and product view (normal vs. exploded view) on consumers' comprehension, attitude and purchase intention. Drawing on construct-level theory, we expect the construal congruence between product view and textual description makes positive effects. Through two controlled experiments (N = 815), results demonstrate that the influence of product view changes with abstractness of description. When processing concrete product descriptions, participants' imagery vividness was facilitated by exploded view, which further led to enhanced comprehension, improved attitude and higher purchased intention. When encountering abstract product descriptions, normal product view led to higher comprehension and attitude. Mental imagery vividness mediated the interaction influence between textual descriptions and pictorial views.

More so, we posit that this relationship is positively moderated by salesperson moral identity, such that the relationship is strengthened at higher levels of moral identity.

Recent IS security research, primarily grounded on assumptions of employees' rational assessment of numerous factors, has yielded inconsistent results. Challenging this paradigm, we model secure behaviour on security knowledge mechanisms, which focuses on the multidimensional nature of security knowledge breadth, depth and finesse to represent the full array of managerial levers. We further draw on construal level theory to conceptualise users' perceptual judgements of security messages. Two studies support our model, with the second building on the first.

Design/methodology/approach: Two experiments were conducted to test the propositions. Findings: Consumers perceived the low-price (low-quality) characteristic of private-label products as a high-level (low-level) construal consideration when forming purchase decisions. Product relevance negatively affected consumers’ perceived product distance. Compared with store brands, separate brands enhanced consumer product attitudes and purchase intentions. Brand strategies and product distance affected consumer message-processing mindset (i.e. resistant to persuasion or open to persuasion) when processing advertisements, ultimately moderating the effect of spokesperson expertise. Practical implications: The findings are useful for hypermarkets seeking to implement brand strategies and select spokespersons for private-label products. Additionally, the findings show that advertisers should design advertising elements to match consumers’ construal approaches to product-related information. Originality/value: This study contrasts two common hypermarket brand strategies, identifies the construal levels corresponding to the dual roles of private-label products and expands CLT dimensions.

Yet, little is known about how and why the timeliness of such CI (e.g., “updated just now”) influences users' selections of differently crowded locations and the effectiveness of location recommendations. Addressing this knowledge gap is, however, important to understand how to design DSS interfaces that prevent (over)crowding and improve related DSS reuse intentions. Drawing on construal level theory, we applied a mixed-methods approach comprising a quantitative and a complementary qualitative study. First, we conducted an online experiment in which 171 participants selected between differently crowded bars. The quantitative data provides evidence that high (vs. low) timeliness of CI leads users to select less crowded bars and raises users' DSS reuse intentions. Yet, the effect of high (vs. low) timeliness of CI on location selection is unexpectedly cancelled out when location recommendations are displayed. In subsequent qualitative interviews with DSS users we find that even though high (vs. low) timeliness of CI affords more conscious elaboration on CI's costs and benefits and increased trusting beliefs, present (vs. absent) location recommendations decrease one's cognitive effort and are more influential than timeliness of CI with regard to the actual location selection. Furthermore, high (vs. low) timeliness of CI enhances positive user perceptions, explaining the increased DSS reuse intentions. Overall, we provide novel insights on the role of timeliness of information for DSS to influence crowding behavior. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

However, despite the popularity of contractions, there is no existing work on how their use can influence individuals’ information processing. Given that language—not just the text but also linguistic forms—can exert an influence on information processing, the possibility that contractions might also do so warrants investigation. Across three experiments, we examine the effect of contractions on consumers’ product choices and judgments. We find that contractions increase choice for products that are higher on feasibility (vs desirability) and those with secondary (vs primary) features while they decreased intentions to engage in COVID-protection behaviors that would be high on feasibility. These effects are consistent with greater concrete thinking.

Larger-scale studies exploring the link between proximity and support have been hampered by data quality and availability. We draw on a unique data set that includes geo-coded data from national surveys (nine waves; n = 19,098) and high-resolution well location data to explore the relationship between proximity and both familiarity with and support for hydraulic fracturing. We use two different measures of proximity-respondent distance to the nearest well and the density of wells within a certain radius of the respondent's location. We find that both types of proximity to new development are linked to more familiarity with hydraulic fracturing, even after controlling for various individual and contextual factors, but only distance-based proximity is linked to more support for the practice.

Considering detection at low (vs. high) levels of thought reduced fear and increased health persuasion. Illness prevention is driven by self-efficacy perceptions and considering prevention at high (vs. low) levels of thought increases persuasion. In further evidence of process, trait fear moderated the detection effects, and dispositional self-efficacy moderated the prevention effects. As an intervention, framing a detection action as serving illness-prevention goals increased people’s likelihood of engaging with an online breast cancer detection tool. These findings illuminate the psychology of detection as being distinct from the psychology of prevention, identify the role of fear in the consideration of health behaviors, and show contexts in which construal levels have divergent effects on health persuasion. © American Marketing Association 2020."

To understand the impact of nostalgia and forestalgia, qualitative background interviews were conducted with creative directors and other advertising creatives from numerous nationally recognized advertising agencies. Building on the insights from the interviews and using construal level theory as our foundation, we explore consumer response to hedonic and utilitarian products when appeals employ far-past, near-past, near-future, and far-future framing. Thus, we examine whether nostalgia or forestalgia is better suited for certain products. We find utilitarian products are better received with a temporal distance that is far from the present with hedonic products better suited for appeals framed in the far past and near future.

However, consumers may make unfavorable inferences about highly aesthetic products due to concerns about the products’ functionality. To address the issue of how retailers can most effectively engage in the deployment and promotion of product aesthetics, the present research proposes that consumers will respond more favorably (i.e., enhanced choice of product, enhanced product and advertisement evaluations, and a heightened willingness to pay) to a highly aesthetic product when they are in an abstract, rather than a concrete, mindset. Five studies using multiple product categories and applying various mindset manipulations provide convergent evidence to support the proposed hypothesis. The findings hold true for utilitarian, but not hedonic, products, and the focus of attention on product functionality accounts for the results.

Drawing from the literature on authenticity and construal level theory, this study aims to investigate the role of perceived authenticity and message construal level in consumers’ evaluations of two types of organic food (fresh vs. processed). Two experiments were conducted among college students (N = 129, Study 1) and adults 18–70 (N = 249, Study 2). Our findings suggest that consumers’ evaluations of organic food are fully mediated by perceived authenticity of each organic food type. Specifically, compared to processed organic food, consumers perceive fresh organic food more authentic, which leads to more favorable attitudes and higher purchase intention. This research further demonstrates that the indirect effect of organic food type via perceived authenticity is moderated by construal level of marketing messages. That is, when messages are construed at a low level, consumers tend to have more positive attitudes and higher purchase intention toward fresh than processed organic food. By contrast, product type makes no difference when messages are construed at a high level.

If consumers remain loyal to a brand, it is because they understand, sympathize with, and value the brand’s concept. However, few studies have focused on brand concept as a factor of loyalty. Therefore, this study verified the influence of the brand concept on repurchase intention. Through multiple regression analysis of Apple MacBook Pro, Dyson Big Ball, Nintendo Switch, Facebook, Starbucks, and Tokyo Disney Resort users in Japan, the first hypothesis—consumers who recall a brand concept are more likely to have repurchase intention than those who recall specific features when asked about brand attractiveness—was supported. Furthermore, Fisher’s exact test supported a second hypothesis—consumers with high loyalty maintain high-level construal, even if they use a brand frequently and recall the concept as the brand’s attractiveness, contrary to construal level theory. By introducing the viewpoint of brand loyalty, the conditions under which construal level theory does not conform were shown.

The attribute-based pattern leads to high construal levels and choices driven by desirability-related, high-level attributes (e.g., design). But when the same information is acquired following the alternative-based pattern, it leads to low construal levels and choices driven by feasibility-related, low-level attributes (e.g., price). As a consequence, choice shares for products whose strength lies in convenience and other feasibility-related features are boosted by the presentation of alternative-based information. Conversely, choice shares for products whose strength lies in design and other desirability-related features are increased by the presentation of attribute-based information.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a single factor (close social distance vs great social distance vs control group) using a between-subjects experimental design. The social distance was manipulated by the presence (i.e. a close social distance) or absence (i.e. a great social distance) of a consumer scene in a craftsmanship video shown on social media. The control group watched a video with non-craftsmanship content. Then, brand experience, perceived luxury and purchase intentions were measured. Findings: The results showed that the control group perceived less luxury and had lower brand experiences and purchase intentions than the group that watched the video without a consumer scene. In addition, participants who watched the craftsmanship video that included a consumer scene (i.e. a close social distance) had stronger brand experiences than those who watched the video without the scene (i.e. a great social distance).

The results from five studies (Studies 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, and 3) demonstrate that when consumers perceive a far psychological distance from environmental issues, up-displaying eco-friendly products can enhance their processing fluency for product information, resulting in more positive product evaluations and higher purchase intentions.

The studies support the contention that when consumers use concrete construal to process information, they will focus on ingroup cues and make ethical consumption decisions that are aligned with ingroup biases. However, when consumers use abstract construal, they will act more consistently with their inner goals rather than focusing on ingroup and outgroup cues.

We explore another option: leaders may simply be unwilling to enforce moral norms because of a negative attitude towards them. We argue and show that leaders that construe norms on relatively low (i.e. concrete) levels are likely to see norms as annoying obstacles, whereas leaders that construe moral norms on high (i.e. abstract) levels will have a more positive view of norms. In line with this, high construal level leaders are likely to be willing to enforce moral norms through discipline in response to follower moral transgressions. Low construal level leaders, in contrast, actively avoid doing so. We show this effect in different contexts and for different types of leader discipline. © 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Moreover, research also found maximizers to be trapped in a “maximization-regret-maximization” cycle. This paper aims to assess the role of construal level theory in alleviating regret felt by maximizers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the construal level theory (CLT) in conjunction with the choice context (comparable and non-comparable choices). Three experimental studies tested our assertion that a match between CLT mindset and choice set relieves regret for maximizers. Findings: The authors show maximizers experience similar levels of regret compared to satisficers when considering comparable options in a concrete mindset, and non-comparable options in an abstract mindset. However, maximizers experience heightened regret in comparison to satisficers when considering non-comparable (comparable) options in a concrete (abstract) mindset. Choice difficulty mediates our effect. Research limitations/implications: Future research is needed to replicate our results in real-life settings. Practical implications: If marketers think that their product is likely to be compared with other comparable products, they should adopt product-specific information that focusses on how the product would be used. However, if marketers think that consumers will compare across non-comparable products, then they should focus on why their product is the most suitable to fulfil consumers’ needs. Originality/value: This research represents the first attempt at reducing regret for maximizers and answers the call for an examination of the relationship between maximization and CLT.

Applying construal-level theory in the context of advance selling of tickets for experience services, this research demonstrates that who (near vs. far social distance), when (near vs. far temporal distance), and where (spatial distance) influence price sensitivity and perceived value of the experience service. Study 1 finds that consumers are more price sensitive when they consider the advance purchase of events taking place further in the future, unless they are experienced, as Study 2 finds. Across both studies, buyers perceive greater value when the time and location of the event are psychologically near. Compared to when social distance is near (self-reference), consumers construe other average buyers in the market to be relatively more price sensitive and to perceive relatively higher value for experience services. Since an important factor at work in the minds of buyers is other buyers, the results imply that service providers should frame offers in reference more to others than the self for experiences. The effects of time and distance suggest managers should carefully geo-target offers customized to when and where customers are when buying tickets. As experienced buyers have learned to be price sensitive for tickets, managers should identify these individuals to provide relevant value-added offers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."

Study 2 also showed that other-oriented perspective taking is the mechanism through which construal level promotes interactional justice enactment.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted two studies to test our hypotheses. In Study 1, the authors explored consumers' general preferences for domestic and foreign brands. Based on the evidence, Study 2 further explored the moderating roles of decision focus and product quality. Findings: In general, consumers in developing countries prefer foreign brands. The effect can be moderated by the decision focus that this preference will be more obvious when consumers buy for others than when they buy for themselves. Product quality can also moderate the role of decision focus; in other words, consumers' preference for foreign brand when buying for others will be stronger when the product quality is low than when the product quality is high. Practical implications: Foreign brands have a natural appeal to local consumers in developing countries. Moreover, foreign brands can also invoke consumers' awareness of buying for others (such as giving gifts) to boost sales. Domestic brands are at a disadvantage comparing to foreign brands, but they can increase their attractiveness by invoking consumers' awareness of rewarding themselves. In addition, domestic brands need to improve product quality to fundamentally improve their competitiveness.

These alignments lead consumers to experience more positive affect generated by imagining the good they are doing for their bodies (with absolute labeling of virtues) or focusing on the positive feelings of indulgence (with relative labeling of vices), leading to larger preferred sizes.

Up till now, research on voice endorsement has lacked unified theoretical frameworks that can shed light on antecedents of voice endorsement in a more integrative way as well as help identify new and relevant antecedents in a systematic and theory-based manner. We propose that construal-level theory can serve as one such unifying framework and showcase this potential by applying it to voice endorsement. Drawing on construal-level theory we propose that when an employee frames his/her voice messages in a manner that is compatible with the psychological distance between the employee and the supervisor, the supervisor will find the employee’s voice messages easier to process and, consequently, will be more likely to endorse them. Three experiments using different manipulations of voice message frame and psychological distance, and a mini meta-analysis of the three experiments, provide support for our construal compatibility hypothesis and initial evidence for the experienced ease-of-processing logic. We discuss how our construal-level approach to voice endorsement can shed light on previous findings as well as open up new avenues for future research. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Yet, when and what management response is more effective and under what circumstances remains under-researched. This study aims to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach: In three experiments using five different products, the authors manipulate psychological construal level (psychological distance: distant vs proximal) and management response (response of primary vs secondary features) and thereafter assess their bearings on consumer psychological and behavioral reaction toward products of two distinctive natures (hedonic vs utilitarian). Findings: At a psychological distance, consumers show a preferable reaction to management response of primary over secondary features. In contrast, when the psychological distance is proximal, consumers react more positively to management response of secondary than primary features. In addition, these effects vary as a function of product nature, hedonic vs utilitarian. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this research bring a significant contribution to marketing communication literature and extend the construal level theory. Practical implications: A better understanding of the relative effectiveness of distinct types of management response to negative consumer comments is essential for more targeted and effective marketing strategies. Originality/value: Little research has documented the effects of distinct types of management response. How psychological distance might underpin these effects has not been explored.

Findings: (1) the matching of construal level and visual crowding has a significant effect on consumers’ buying intention. (2) Perceptual fluency mediates the interaction between the construal level and visual crowding on buying intention. Research limitations/implications: This study measures consumers' buying intention through situational experiments but does not measure consumers' buying behavior through real scenarios. Practical implications: According to the study conclusions, consumers prefer visually crowded packaging that matches their construal level. Enterprises should consider the impact of the construal level on the effect of packaging stimulation.

At the same time, they face increasing regulatory pressures to inform these customers of the way their personal data are collected and used. To reach acceptable levels of transparency in marketplace interactions, companies thus now need to communicate both the benefits and the risks associated with the disclosure of personal information. An explicit mention of these risks, however, may exert a negative impact on the amount of personal information that consumers agree to disclose. Using a construal-level theoretical lens, this research explores how companies can address this transparency trade-off and tests communication strategies they can use to overcome it. Findings show that companies’ framings of the benefits and risks of sharing information affect disclosures, leading consumers to share more personal data than their privacy preferences would suggest. Three experiments confirm that when consumers are exposed to concrete (vs. abstract) privacy risks, they perceive personal questions as more sensitive (Study 1) and are less likely to reveal personal information (Study 2). However, when exposed to privacy protection statements (rather than privacy risks per se), consumers reveal more information if those statements are concrete (Study 3). The studies also reveal an interaction effect between the benefits and risks of sharing information, such that the abstraction level of risks influences information disclosure only if the benefits of disclosure are concrete. Consumers’ feelings of vulnerability also act as a mediating variable, in support of the relevance of construal level theory for explaining information disclosure processes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

Using a representative sample of the UK population, we aim to estimate and better understand the trade-offs people make when comparing mortality risks, drawing on psychological insights from construal level and regulatory focus theories. We design a stated preference survey using a relative valuation framework with nonmonetary, risk–risk trade-off questions between extreme weather event and traffic accident mortality risks. We find evidence of an extreme weather event risk premium of 1.2–1.6 (implying a climate-related VSL of £2.52–£3.41 million).

Specifically, consumers at higher construal levels tend to view their behavior as more self-expressive and are thus less likely to imitate other consumers’ unethical behavior. Study 1 indicates that focal consumers who have a chronic tendency to construe information at high levels are less likely to replicate other consumers’ unethical behavior than those who have a chronic tendency to construe information at low levels. Studies 2, 3a and 3b show that when primed with higher-level construals, consumers are less likely to follow other consumers’ unethical behavior than when primed with lower-level construals.

This finding challenges the traditional view of SJTs as low-fidelity simulations that rely on ‘situational’ (context-dependent) judgment. However, media richness theory and construal level theory suggest that situation descriptions presented in a richer and more concrete format (video format) will reduce uncertainty about inherent requirements and facilitate the perception that the situation is taking place in the here and now. Therefore, we hypothesized that situational judgment would be more important in video situation descriptions than in text situation descriptions. We adapted a leadership SJT to realize a 3 (situation description in the item stem: video vs. text vs. none) × 2 (response format: video response options vs. text response options) between-subjects design (N = 279). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the six conditions. The removal of video-based situation descriptions in item stems led to an equivalent decrease in SJT scores as the removal of text-based situation descriptions in item stems (video-based version: Cohen's d = 0.535 vs. text-based version: Cohen's d = 0.531). SJT scores were also contingent on the presentation format of both situation descriptions and response options: The highest scores were observed when situation descriptions and response options were presented in the same format. Implications for SJT theory and research are discussed. Practitioner points: The presentation format did not moderate the effect of omitting situation descriptions in SJTs – that is, the context dependency of SJT performance did not increase when the SJT was administered in a video-based rather than a text-based format. The elimination of situation descriptions in item stems had a medium effect on overall test scores: SJT scores were significant lower without situation descriptions in comparison to SJT scores with situation descriptions (video-based version: Cohen's d = 0.535 vs. text-based version: Cohen's d = 0.531).

The findings show that ChatGPT exhibits an abstraction bias, generating responses consistent with a high-level construal. This abstraction bias results in ChatGPT prioritising high-level construal features (e.g., desirability) over low-level construal features (e.g., feasibility) in consumer evaluation scenarios. Thus, ChatGPT recommendations differ significantly from traditional results based on human decision-making. Applying CLT concepts to large language models provides essential insights into how consumer behaviour may evolve with the increasing prevalence and capability of AI and offers many promising avenues for future research. © 2023 The Author"

The authors show that less established descriptors (i.e. identity-linking messages low in prototypicality) can be optimal for an important customer segment, namely, for those that affectively identify with the social group. This is because of the distinct self-motives underlying the cognitive and affective social identity dimensions. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot and two experimental studies were conducted, using gender and nationality as the target identities. Findings: Consumers feel more hopeful and have higher purchase intention for products advertised using identity depictions that fit with their predominant (uncertainty-reduction or self-enhancement) self-motive. Consumers predominantly high in affective/cognitive social identity prefer identity-linking messages that are low/high in prototypicality. An abstract mindset reverses these effects by encouraging a similarity focus. Research limitations/implications: Future work should identify potential boundary conditions of the findings. Further, all studies use ascribed social groups. Future work should explore whether consumers relate differently to different social group, such as achieved groups, non-human groups or aspirational groups. Practical implications: Adverts using established descriptors of a brand’s target social group may no longer fit the brand’s positioning. Understanding when and when not to use less established group descriptors to market brands is important for practitioners. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research to explore the conditions under which priming consumers’ identity using less/more established (i.e. low/high in prototypicality) descriptors has a beneficial, or detrimental, effect on consumers’ purchase intention.

Two choice studies demonstrate that FSR favors sustainable product choice when the consumer decides between equally sustainable products.

Nonetheless, organizational actors often struggle to remain impartial in situations that call for punishment. Impartiality appears specifically hard to obtain when some element of the transgression reflects badly upon the punisher themselves, for instance, when in the past the punisher has benefited from the misbehavior, even if just derivatively. In this paper, we argue that in such cases, punishers tend to defensively attribute causes of the transgression to the circumstances in order to protect their own self-image, thus leading them to relatively lenient punishments. However, we also suggest that psychological impartiality can be obtained through cognitive abstraction. An abstract understanding (high-level construal) of the punitive situation puts the focus squarely on the gist of the situation and makes circumstantial details less likely to be cognitively available. This hinders defensive circumstantial attribution. We show in a field study and an experiment that partiality in making decisions about punishments occurs under conditions of low-level (i.e., concrete) construal, whereas impartiality is facilitated by high-level (i.e., abstract) construal. © 2020 The Authors.

Despite important implications for branding, advertising and celebrity endorsement, little is known about how to attenuate the effect. This paper aims to introduce a mechanism which attenuates the dissociative group effect by drawing on construal level theory. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach was used which included two-part between-subjects designs. Findings: High identifiers prefer products linked to their ingroup over ones linked to a dissociative group, however, the opposite is true for low identifiers. The difference in preference is attenuated for high and low identifiers when they are placed in an abstract mind-set. The underlying mechanism of this effect is similarity focus. Research limitations/implications: The same context was used to ensure that the attenuating effect found was not due to contextual factors. However, further studies should replicate the findings in a wider variety of contexts. Practical implications: This research offers practical recommendations on how to manage multiple customer segments in increasingly diverse marketplaces. By inducing an abstract mind-set in customers, for example, via advertising copy, website architecture or contextual factors such as pitch of the music, marketers can increase the effectiveness of identity-linking marketing for consumers’ high/low in identification.

This research addresses the inconsistent findings by using construal level theory (CLT) to explain how temporal distance and argument nature affect fear-appeal appraisal. Based on two online experiments, we report evidence showing that temporal distance determines which antecedents drive fear-appeal outcomes, which helps explain inconsistent results found in prior literature.

Based on construal level theory, one would expect that consumers cognitively represent the individual and collective outcomes of an allocation policy at different levels of abstraction and that they evaluate allocation policies more positively when there is congruency between the cognitive representation of the policy's focal outcome and the spatial and temporal distance inherently present in the policy's decision context (e. g., allocation decisions on a future policy). However, we hypothesize that this congruency effect can be overruled by a high vested interest mindset that is activated by an individual's recent personal experience with a health care service provider. Since a high vested interest mindset increases the relevance of the allocation policy implementation for the individual because s/he perceives strong personal consequences, we propose that for consumers with recent experience the evaluation of an allocation policy that focuses on individual outcomes is higher than that of a policy that focuses on collective outcomes irrespective of the spatial and temporal distance in the decision context.

Synthesizing construal level theory, expectancy theory, compensation activation theory, and Call and Ployhart's (2020) theory of firm value capture from employee job performance, we provide insights into how employees develop PFP perceptions when they are covered by a complex PFP system. We propose that (1) individuals shape PFP perceptions at different levels of mental construals, ranging from concrete to abstract; (2) concrete conceptualizations lead to specific, detailed, multidimensional perceptions of PFP system elements (i.e., expectancy, instrumentality, valence, and incentive-intensity) while abstract conceptualizations lead to more general perceptions with fewer perceived dimensions; (3) an individual's construal level can change over time because of characteristics of the PFP system as well as external events, and (4) construal levels have different implications for PFP system effectiveness at the individual and organizational levels.

In this paper, we propose that signals of the planning fallacy can be detected in a project’s business case. We investigated whether language usage in business cases can serve as an early warning signal for overruns in IS projects. Drawing on two theoretical perspectives–the Linguistic Category Model (LCM) and Construal Level Theory (CLT)–two sets of rival hypotheses were tested concerning the relationship between project overruns and whether the language usage in a business case is abstract or concrete. A linguistic analysis of the business cases of large IS projects in the Netherlands suggests that concrete language usage in the business case is associated with bigger budget and schedule overruns.

Drawing on construal level theory from social psychology, we propose that the association between subsidiaries' exposure to host-country terrorist attacks and MNEs' likelihood of divesting these subsidiaries depends on their executives' social distance from the event host country. Based on a sample of Fortune US 100 MNEs and their foreign subsidiaries from 2003 to 2014, we find that on average, MNEs are more likely to divest their subsidiaries when their exposure to host-country terrorist attacks increases; however, the effect is only prominent in host countries to which MNE executives are socially proximate. Managerial Summary: MNEs confronting terrorism threats in a host country sometimes respond by divesting subsidiaries exposed to the threats even when the high opportunity costs of divestment render this response irrational. We argue that the MNEs' divestment response may not be driven by rational economic calculations but by their executive’ subjective threat perceptions. We investigate how top executives’ subjective threat perceptions, as a function of their social distance from the event host country, influence MNEs’ divestment decisions. We find that on average, MNEs do tend to divest their subsidiaries when they are exposed to a high terrorism threat in a host country; however, they are much less likely to do so when their top executives are socially distant from the focal host country. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

However, negotiators are not always rational decision makers. It is not uncommon to find that negotiations fail despite the tabling of notable settlement options. Having the intention to settle is paramount in achieving an amicable settlement. To improve the success rate of construction dispute negotiations, this study posits exploring negotiators' intention to settle from the perspective of how they perceive failure. Applying construal-level theory (CLT) and the concept of psychological distance (PD), it is hypothesized that construction dispute negotiators having the proximal psychological distance of negotiation failure would raise the respective concern that mediates intention to settle. With data collected from experienced construction dispute negotiators, the results of the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) supported the hypothesis. The findings of the study indicated that the negotiators' distal perception of and low concern for failure can obscure their intention to settle. Furthermore, the results indicated that a reduced PD could enhance negotiators' intention to settle. This finding explains why reality testing is effective in steering negotiators' decisions along a rational course. In practice, a realistic assessment of the consequences of a negotiation failure by either the negotiation team or a neutral third party would raise attention to failure. The resulting proximal PD would lead to a stronger intention to settle. The study is novel in (1) offering a vital theoretical link between the perception of failure and the settlement intention; and (2) anchoring the functions of reality testing with the concept of PD. Practical Applications The resolution of construction disputes typically starts with negotiations. Negotiated settlements are the most economical outcome, as a high price can be paid if resource-laden resolution mechanisms are deployed. It is disappointing to see promising negotiations fail because the negotiators were not prepared for a settlement. This study addresses the practical issue of how to make the best use of construction dispute negotiations. Having the intention to settle is paramount should positive negotiation outcomes be envisaged. The concept of psychological distance explains that if one perceives failure not to be imminent, the concern for failure will be low, and thereby no pressing need to settle. This proposition was supported in this study. The practical application of the study could be the intervention strategy of reality testing, which has been proven instrumental in facilitating negotiations. Third-party neutrals, particularly mediators, have high regard for the effectiveness of reality testing. The function of realistic assessment in enhancing settlement is the result of reframing negotiators' subjective cognition and raising the concern for failure. This study contributes to negotiation practice by offering a solid theoretical base to explain why and how reality testing is one of the most versatile tools to assist negotiations. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The effect of temporal distance on attitudes toward a policy is mediated by people's attention to different aspects of the policy (desirability vs. feasibility, pros vs. cons, self vs. other) (Study 4). Furthermore, temporal distance enhances support for policies that are high, but not low, in desirability for the collective (Study 5).

However, observing others’ decisions may also activate motives that prevent this potential from being realized, for instance, ego concerns that prompt excessive risk taking. Our experimental study investigates how two features of the social environment influence the effect of observing others’ decisions on individual risk taking and performance. We manipulated (1) the psychological distance to others whose decisions could be observed (and thereby the tendency to seek self-enhancing social comparison) and (2) the opportunity for interaction (and thereby for a cumulative effect of any such tendency on decisions over time and for an effect on social information itself). Because the two features covary in real-world settings, we designed two treatments corresponding to the two natural combinations. Both treatments provided participants with two other participants’ period decisions in a multiperiod problem under uncertainty. No new objective information about the problem could be inferred from these decisions. We predicted that participants who observed the decisions of distant others (who had solved the same problem earlier) would perform better than participants in a control sample without any information about others’ decisions and that participants who observed the decisions of proximal others (with whom interaction could arise) would take more risk and perform worse than those who observed distant others’ decisions.

Drawing on construal level theory to explain the risk behavior and goal time horizon of FF owner-managers, we propose and find that the presence of later family generations in control positively influences DPI in FFs, while the presence of a family CEO is detrimental to DPI. Furthermore, we propose that these relationships are moderated by the size of the top management team (TMT), finding that a larger TMT weakens the positive relationship between later generations in control and DPI.

Unlike the PC, many consumers form an emotional attachment relationship with their mobile (Vincent 2006). Consequently, these attached consumers demonstrate unique behaviors with and without their mobile (e.g., Kolsaker et al. 2009; Konok et al. 2016; Melumad and Pham 2020). Research to date has focused mainly on the consequence of separating from mobile while paying little attention to other aspects of mobile attachment. This study aims to uncover the impact of mobile attachment on their perception and the underneath mechanism. The context of our research is based on climate change communication. Through three laboratory experiments based on a combination of Attachment Theory and Construal Level Theory, we highlight the importance of psychological distance, attachment styles, and gender for the perceived credibility of an ad. Our results suggested that attached to mobile consumers tend to have a more psychological distant perspective on their mobile than when they are on PC. This is achieved by a heightened level of anxiety when attached to mobile consumers are away from their device, which leads to a more proximal psychological distance perception. This change in perception directly impacts the perceived credibility of the ad. This effect is moderated by their personal attachment style and by their gender. However, the actual differences between conditions are marginal, albeit statistically significant. The reported level of anxiety also seems high across our sample, which could be attributed to the ongoing pandemic at the time of data collection. Our findings have important implications for effective communication planning in climate-related subjects and various others within the emerging context of mobile. A dedicated approach should be made for heavy mobile users. And climate change ad should be described abstractly to match the consumers’ viewpoint on mobile.

More particularly, would emojis related to our senses (e.g. or ) be able to activate sensory imagery such as touch or auditory imagery? If sensory emojis produce sensory imagery into which appropriate background color (e.g. red vs blue) they have to be inserted in order to enhance consumers’ responses? Indeed, atmospheric variables such as color are important marketing tools that attract and shape consumers’ perceptions (Labrecque and Milne 2012).We leverage Construal level theory (CLT) that provides a theoretical framework to predict in which appropriate background color specific sensory emojis have to be inserted. We suggest that sensory emojis related to proximal (distal) senses such as touch (hear) have to be integrated in red (blue) background color. We explain these combinations through the fit between psychological distance associated with senses and the construal level activated by red or blue color. We run an experiment, in a real situation, that tests the interplay between sensory emojis (touch vs hearing) and background colors (red vs blue) inserted into a starter email of a chatbot. A residual means analysis (Umesh et al. 1996) suggest that inserted proximal (distal) sensory emoji into red (blue) background is the optimal combination that enhances consumers' responses. These first results contribute to literature on emoji by showing that color background play an important role in the use of emoji into an email. Moreover, we contribute to CLT by showing that this framework could predict the effect of interplay between sensorial elements such as sensory emojis and color.

Food companies could announce an ingredient name by using its common name focusing on the effects of a food component familiar to consumers (i.e., the name of the compound) or its specific and academia-based name (i.e., scientific name). Ares et al. (2009) indicated that displaying ingredient name affected consumer’s food evaluation. Drawing from construal level theory (Trope et al. 2007), we propose that consumers will look for advertising cues, which are congruent with high or low construal level that will facilitate or eliminate the effectiveness of ingredient name. Two moderators are proposed: food types (vice vs. virtue) and regulatory foci (promotion vs. prevention). Two experiments show that a common name works better than a scientific name when vice food is promoted with promotion focus. On the other hand, a scientific name is more persuasive when virtue food is presented with prevention focus. The choice of ingredient name does not matter when vice food with prevention focus or food virtue with promotion focus is promoted. This research further demonstrates that perceived guilt and perceived efficacy respectively serve as the underlying mechanism for vice and virtue foods. The current research makes theoretical contributions. First, it expands the knowledge and usage of food label in choosing the compatible ingredient name. The right combinations lead to higher product evaluations. Second, construal level theory explains how the different psychological construals will influence the effects of ingredient names. The results support the notion that a common (scientific) name is associated with high (low) construal level. Finally, the underlying mechanisms of perceived guilt and perceived efficacy enhance the knowledge and understanding behind the interaction effect. The usage of presenting ingredient name offers important implications for both brand managers and marketers. First, marketers should consider how to eliminate the weakness of the product attributes and strengthen the benefits. Second, marketers should try to lower the perceived guilt of consumers vice consumption and increase the perceived efficacy of the virtue food by varying ingredient name and regulatory focus. Finally, vice and virtue are not always bipolar. Advertisers are able to frame their product in more vice or virtue by focusing hedonic attributes (e.g., taste or eating enjoyment) or utilitarian attributes (e.g., health goal or freshness). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

This study aims to propose that construal level impacts how consumers process information and looks at how two dimensions of psychological distance affect the persuasiveness of different types of advertising appeals. Design/methodology/approach: Four experimental studies test the singular effects that social and temporal distance construals have on the persuasiveness of advertising appeals. This research further investigates whether social distance construals can be situationally primed and matched with advertising appeals to improve willingness to pay. Overall, the combined effects are tested when both dimensions are simultaneously activated, but the valence of the construal levels potentially moves in opposite directions. Findings: Studies 1 and 3 find that matching social distance construals and advertising appeals positively impacts willingness to pay, whereas Study 2 reveals that matching temporal distance construals and advertising appeals also positively effects willingness to pay. Furthermore, Study 4 finds that the social distance dimension has a more dominant impact on willingness to pay, except in near future scenarios when there are combined effects of competing construals. Research limitations/implications: This research indicates that initial social distance construals are more salient than subsequent temporal distance construals. Practical implications: This study helps marketers to identify the most effective advertising appeals for consumers with different types of relationships and psychological distance construals.

Moreover, by integrating insights from construal level theory, this research sheds new light on the ways people think about their personal life activities as playing a discernible role in how people can generate and/or apply resources from their activities. Results of two multiwave studies revealed that people who tend to engage in a greater breadth of personal life activities can gain nonwork cognitive developmental resources (i.e., skills, knowledge, and perspectives) that, in turn, enhance their creativity at work. Personal life construal level also moderated the resource generation stage of enrichment, but not resource application to work; people who adopted lower construal level (i.e., more concretely: how they do activities) were more likely to generate cognitive developmental resources from their participation in personal life activities versus those with higher construal level (i.e., more abstractly: why they do activities).

Furthermore, consumers at a higher level construal tend to focus on the desirability of an activity’s end state, whereas those at a lower level construal tend to focus on the feasibility of the means (Liberman & Trope, 1998). Given that utilitarian expenses are generally instrumental and perceived as means to an end, whereas hedonic expenses are more likely to be perceived as an end goal normally associated with sensory and experiential fulfillments (Batra & Ahtola, 1990; Hirschman & Holbrook, 1982), it is plausible that budget setting for hedonic versus utilitarian categories varies as a function of construal level. If at higher levels of construal consumers focus on the desirability of an activity’s end state, budgeting of hedonic purchases should be higher when a higher (versus lower) construal is activated. Alternatively, the instrumental value of utilitarian purchases would not vary as much across construal-level conditions leading to minimal changes in budget setting across construal levels. I conducted two experiments to test this proposition. In the first experiment, I test the moderating effect of consumption type (hedonic vs. utilitarian) on over-budgeting. The second experiment examined construal level as an underlying process while ruling out an estimation bias explanation. Both experiments were conducted with participants recruited from Amazon Mechanic Turk. In conclusion, results from two experiments support the proposition that, contingent on type of consumption, construal plays an important role on consumer budget setting. Above and beyond confidence of estimation, consumers tend to set larger budgets for hedonic consumption when construal level is higher (vs. lower), whereas budgeting setting for utilitarian consumption does not vary as a function of construal level.

While fashion businesses have increasingly sought to manage their sustainability practices, their understanding of how to communicate about sustainability persuasively remains limited. The authors argue that a key problem with a firm’s efforts in communicating about sustainability is that it is a psychologically distant issue for both businesses and stakeholders. This paper aims to apply construal level theory to explore managers’ construal level in shaping communication about sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used a two-phase qualitative methodology. Phase one involved undertaking interviews with ten managers in fashion firms to address communications about sustainability in the UK. In phase two, 16 consumers interpreted and reflected on the persuasiveness of communications about sustainability encompassing both concrete and abstract forms of messaging. Findings: The authors identify the factors driving different approaches to communication (concrete and abstract) depending on the construal levels of managers, managers’ perceptions of the construal level of target stakeholders and the perceived authenticity of the sustainability claim. The paper highlights the conditions under which the (mis)match with the brands’ sustainable practices works in crafting communication. The authors also highlight three main communication strategies in responding to the complexity of sustainability in fashion ecosystems: amplification, quiet activist and populist coupling. Research limitations/implications: As an in-depth qualitative study, the authors seek to expose an under-researched phenomenon, yet generalisations both within the fashion industry and beyond are limited by this focus. Practical implications: Fashion managers need to be flexible and evaluate how their communications about sustainability affect stakeholders’ evaluations of their brands. As sustainability in fashion brands grows, concrete and specific sustainability messaging may be necessary to improve sustainable behaviours. Originality/value: The prevailing literature encourages symbiosis between sustainability practices and communications; such relationships are rare, and studies outside the consumer perspective are also rare. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this exploratory study is the first to understand how managers’ construal level influences decisions around communications about sustainability in fashion and how these messages are perceived by consumers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Through two lab experiments and one field study involving real email campaigns from an international frequent flyer program, we show that the two components work jointly through a Boolean-like mechanism to determine a consumer’s mental construal level. A lower construal level results from simultaneous low tier and distance, which leads to a more favorable response to affective message appeals.

However, scientific scrutiny focused on its performance has produced mixed findings so far (LaTour and Henthorne 1994; Pope et al. 2004). Based on construal-level theory (a paradigm presenting how people construe an entity based on the level of psychological distance they experience from such an entity) (Trope and Liberman 2010) and the concept of psychological distance (the extent to which an entity pertains to an individual’s here and now experience) (Trope et al. 2007), the present research concentrates on erotic appeal ads’ impact in terms of consumers’ moral, attitudinal and behavioral reactions. Also, demographic as well as psychographic factors, such as gender and moral attentiveness (pertaining to the extent to which an individual chronically perceives and considers morality and moral elements in his/her experiences) (Reynolds 2008; Van Gils et al. 2014) are examined. Additionally, further relevant erotic-driven traits such as that of sexual liberalism as well as behavioral traits such as that of product involvement are captured in order to further demystify the network of effects. Findings from two online experimental studies with US-based MTurkers as participants each focused on a different type of psychological distance inducing variant construal levels while promoting a different product category across different ad eroticism intensity levels, show that as psychological distance or construal level increases (decreases) consumers’ reactions become less (more) unfavorable especially, when the ad’s eroticism intensity level varies from moderate to high. Also, reactions vary based on gender and moral attentiveness such that in general, females and high morally attentive individuals denote stronger objections. Last, sexual liberalism and product involvement exert a strong positive influence on consumer reactions. Next, there are important implications stemming from the paper including the importance of applying psychological distance/construal level cues in marketing communications; the caution in using the erotic ad appeal such that it does not produce unfavorable outcomes; and the significance of both gender and moral attentiveness in determining consumers’ reactions to erotic ads. Finally, the paper concludes by referring to its limitations as well as by providing suggestions for future research such as the need to study the phenomenon at hand on a cross-cultural basis and by considering additional individual difference variables in such a research endeavor. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Mere ownership of objects as common as pens and mugs almost instantaneously leads to increased liking (Beggan 1992; Huang et al. 2009), increased valuation (i.e. the endowment effect) (Kahneman et al. 1990; Thaler 1980) and enhanced memory for the object (Cunningham et al. 2008; van den Bos et al. 2010). Ownership to some extent seems to render objects more important, unique and irreplaceable in the eyes of their owners and thus seems to affect the way objects are mentally represented and processed. While extensive research has reported on effects of ownership—e.g. the endowment effect (Thaler 1980) and the mere ownership effect (Beggan 1992)—much of this literature takes a transactional perspective where ownership is acquired or lost in a “legal,” objective way. Recent research shows, however, that psychological ownership—the subjective feeling of being owner—is an important driver of ownership effects (Morewedge et al. 2009; Peck and Shu 2009). We aim to advance the understanding of understudied concept of psychological ownership by relating it to the framework of psychological distance and construal level theory (CLT) (Trope and Liberman 2010). Many authors discussed the importance of “an association” between a person and objects in the genesis and perception of ownership (Beggan and Brown 1994; Friedman 2008). We test the hypothesis that the “(strength of) association” underlying psychological ownership can be seen as psychological closeness, with effects as predicted by CLT. Psychological distance is egocentric; its reference point is the self, here and now (Amit et al. 2009). Given the strong relationship between the self and possessions (Belk 1988; Pierce et al. 2003), it makes sense to see possessions as psychologically close and therefore mentally represented at a low level of construal. High level of construal would highlight abstract properties like core features or the object’s main purpose, which would imply that objects are more readily substitutable with others of the same category. This is of course not the case, as endowment studies show that people are reluctant to trade in even easy-to-replace items like pens and coffee mugs (Kahneman et al. 1990). The studies reported below test the relationships between ownership, construal level and psychological distance. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

Food labels have long been recognized as an important marketing tool, but there is a lack of research on label-free products. To address this gap, this study examined the influence of label-free design on product attractiveness in the Japanese green tea market. Design/methodology/approach: If existing products are used in an experiment, respondents would be subject to brand image bias. Hence, by mechanically combining the main design elements (cap shape, bottle style, decoration line, logo and label) with an orthogonal array, the conditions for bottles with and without labels are completely aligned. The authors conducted an online survey and applied the chi-square test to the attractiveness of 18 designs presented in random order. Findings: Label-free designs were more attractive to consumers than labeled designs. The effect was higher among female, middle-aged and older adults; those with higher annual income and low-frequency purchasers. Practical implications: Practitioners should adopt a label-free design that can satisfy both environmental considerations and customer value. It would be a formidable challenge to change the longstanding emphasis placed on label design, but this study demonstrates the value of doing so. Originality/value: This is the first study in the package design literature on the advantages of label-free plastic bottles. The authors also applied an orthogonal array used for many years to optimize objective numerical values in marketing research. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It integrates the particularities of working virtually to understand if and how the virtual context affects the provision of HCN support for expatriates, and whether related social categorization and identification processes work differently as part of virtual assignments. We draw on social identity and construal level theory and develop a conceptual model explaining the emergence of three types of HCN support that virtual assignees can receive, i.e., emotional support, appraisal support, and informational job support. We focus on the interplay between social categorization mechanisms and higher-level construals and, thus, more interpersonal neutrality and social disengagement originating from the virtual work context.

These deals have two temporal aspects: deal time and lead time. Deal time, the remaining duration before the discount expires, signals scarcity and enhances the deal's appeal. In contrast, lead time, the delay between purchase and receipt/consumption, postpones gratification and diminishes the deal's attractiveness. This study proposes that as deal time and lead time fluctuate, they progressively bring consumers psychologically closer to the act of purchase/consumption. Drawing on construal level theory, we contend that firms can use image zooming as a digital tool to generate product images at various zoom levels and align with the psychological distances induced by deal time or lead time throughout the deal's availability. This strategy amplifies the positive effects of deal time and mitigates the negative impacts of lead time. Our research model is validated by data from three experiments. We discovered that (1) product image zooming affects consumers’ psychological proximity to an online deal; (2) when a deal with a short (long) deal/lead time is paired with a zoom-in (zoom-out) product image, deal evaluation and purchase intention increase; and (3) these effects are mediated by consumers’ “feeling right” experience during deal evaluation, which arises from a match between the construal levels prompted by the temporal feature and the product image.

Emphasizing the (un)healthiness of food by using traffic light labels does not dampen impulsive acquisitions at the point of sale, but does help consumers to consume fewer calories at the expense of wasting more food.

In addition to communicating through sponsorship, sponsors and sponsored entities also communicate about a sponsorship. This form of “sponsorship-linked marketing” is frequently employed when announcing the initiation of a sponsorship via advertising channels and press releases. In this context, marketers are challenged in terms how best to communicate the complex relationship created via corporate sponsorships. However, research on the influence of sponsorship announcements has uncovered mixed results and suffers from two shortcomings. First, previous studies have only considered the announcement of sponsorships at a generic level, while ignoring the potential for variation in how a sponsorship is publicly announced (i.e., the composition of announcements). Second, scholars have emphasized investors’ reaction to announcements while overlooking any potential effects on consumers, who are a more likely target for sponsorship communication. In the present study, we therefore investigate how different types of sponsorship announcements influence consumers’ perceptions of the sponsoring firm. Specifically, based on Construal Level Theory (CLT), we conducted two experiments to investigate how the concreteness of the information contained in an announcement as well as the timing of the announcement influence consumers’ responses to the sponsorship. According to CLT, consumers judge information with different levels of abstraction. The theory generally implies a more concrete (i.e., detailed) interpretation of communication about events close—in time, socially, or geographically—to the consumer; whereas, individuals are apt to interpret communication about events distant to oneself in abstraction. Based on this theoretical foundation, we derive three hypotheses about the effects of different levels of information construal in communication about sponsorships. We anticipate that an announcement containing more concrete details about a sponsorship (i.e., low levels of construal) will result in more positive outcomes for the sponsoring brand (H1) when compared to an announcement composed in greater abstraction (i.e., high levels of construal). Additionally considering consumers’ mental information processing, we hypothesize that for a temporally distant event, concrete information will require more information processing to resolve the disparity between individuals’ expected level of construal and the construal level of the provided information, thereby leading to more favorable evaluations of the sponsoring brand than abstract information (H2). On the other hand, for temporally near events, CLT suggests consumers are already predisposed to a concrete mindset. We therefore assume the level of abstractness of the information provided about events close in time to have no effect on the evaluation of the sponsoring brand (H3). To test the proposed hypotheses, we conducted two separate experiments as online surveys. In the first experiment, we manipulated the construal level of the sponsorship announcement (abstract/concrete) between subjects without any mention or manipulation of the temporal distance to the event. In the second (2 x 2) experiment, we manipulated the temporal distance (near/far) to the sponsored event in addition to the construal level of information content (abstract/concrete). Collectively, the results of the two studies suggest that consumers prefer sponsorship announcements that contain concrete (versus abstract) information, thereby supporting H1. Results of our second study revealed that in support of H2, respondents who were faced with a concrete sponsorship announcement for a distant event evaluated the sponsoring brand more positive than those who were faced with an abstract announcement for a distant event. Hypothesis 3 was also generally supported by the study results; for temporally near events, we find no significant differences between abstract and concrete sponsorship announcements in attitude toward the sponsoring brand, trust, and purchase intention. Willingness to recommend the sponsoring brand, however, was significantly lower among respondents faced with concrete information about a temporally near event than among those who read an abstract announcement. Possible explanations for this intriguing result are discussed in the paper. Overall, the results of both experiments highlight the importance of recognizing CLT in sponsorship-linked communications. On a theoretical level, CLT was found to adequately explain aspects of consumers’ reactions to sponsorship announcements. In general, presenting content at a low construal level (i.e., concrete) is preferable to more abstract information. At the same time, however, the temporal distance to the event at the time of the announcement should be considered, especially when concrete information is not feasible to provide publicly for reasons of confidentiality. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science."

In case of a positive surprise, the unexpectedness quality of the surprise may get associated with the positive affect and in turn may induce an affinity toward unexpectedness for future events. In contrast, after experiencing a negative surprise, people may dislike the quality of unexpectedness and may look to avoid that quality for future events. According to the construal-level theory, high (low) unexpectedness of an event has a reciprocal relationship with a high-level, abstract (low-level, concrete) construal of the event. Therefore, we theorize that an experience of surprise may induce a construal-level mindset such that a positive surprise may lead to an abstract mindset, whereas a negative surprise may lead to a concrete mindset. Consequently, the induced mindset may influence evaluations and judgments of subsequently presented stimuli in the same fashion as abstract/concrete processing of the stimuli would do. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were asked to evaluate promotionally or preventionally framed ad messages following manipulation of surprise. In Study 1, participants in the positive (negative) surprise condition evaluated promotionally (preventionally) framed message more favorably than preventionally (promotionally) framed message for a personal care product. In Study 2, the same pattern of results was observed for a health product. In Study 3, following manipulation of surprise, participants were asked to make a series of trade-offs between factors that alluded to either feasibility or desirability considerations. Participants in the positive surprise condition leaned toward desirability-related factors, whereas those in the negative surprise condition leaned toward feasibility-related factors. The three studies together support the idea that an experience of surprise may induce a construal-level mindset and in turn influence consumer evaluations and judgments of subsequently presented stimuli even when the stimuli are not related to the factors that caused the experience of surprise. Future studies should examine the theorized effects on other relevant dependent variables and also strive for more direct evidence of the induction of construal-level mindset following an experience of surprise. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science."

A better understanding of consumer behaviour in relation to cause-related marketing (CRM) is critical, as both marketers and consumers are able to build a win-win relationship. Borrowing the construal level theory, we examined the effects of advertising framing in CRM, focusing on how construal level and donation magnitude could have affected consumer’s attitude and willingness to donate. The study proposes that words induce high construal level that consumers should have higher buying intention and willingness to participate in a word-vs. picture-based advertisement. Consistent with the previous study, the preliminary study had successfully attributed picture vs. words to low vs. high construal level. However, the main study results failed to indicate a higher intention to participate and to buy among consumers in a high (e.g. 25% of the selling price) vs. low donation magnitude (e.g. 5% of the selling price) condition. The contribution of the current study is expected to extend the construal level theory by assessing the donation magnitude, which affecting consumer behaviour in the marketing context. The findings of the studies added to the understanding of construal level and donation magnitude manipulations in CRM, which benefits both the CRM marketers as well as the academic researchers.

In four experimental studies, two types of VIs and their impact on advertising effectiveness are compared. Key findings are that highly human-like VIs lead to higher trustworthiness, while a more cartoon-like appearance increases novelty. The reasoning behind the varying evaluation of VI types is explored through the lens of psychological distance and construal level theory, suggesting that appropriate message focus enhances the influencers’ benefits as a moderator. It is further shown that different cultural settings play an important role for VI perception, finding that the cartoon-influencer's novelty effect is restricted to consumer groups low in VI familiarity.

For example, students strive to find the best university, major, professor, and academic grade record. A reality check shows that some individuals settle for a “good enough” option. Psychological distance is defined as “a subjective experience that something is close or far away from the self, here, and now” (Trope and Liberman 2010, p. 440). Time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality are the different distance dimensions in which an object might be removed from the self, here, and now (Trope and Liberman 2010). Of particular importance for this study is the social distance dimension defined as the subjective perception or experience of distance between the self and another person or other persons (Stephan et al. 2010). Different forms of social distance exist (e.g., similarity and power). In construal level theory (CLT), social power may cause a sense of distance from others (Trope and Liberman 2010). Previous research has found that individuals in high power positions perceive themselves as more distant from others than those individuals with low power (Hogg 2001). As a result of individuals with social power feeling distant from others, they are influenced to construe information abstractly, establish clear priorities, focus on the central aspects of situations, and disregard secondary aspects (Trope and Liberman 2010). In summary, this research proposes that the level of PDB will influence individuals’ decision-making, that is, whether individuals will maximize or satisfice. In the business world, some consumers make satisficing vs. maximizing decisions. Understanding the process which influences consumers to pursue satisficing vs. maximizing behavior is critical for the effectiveness of marketing messages, success of businesses, and welfare of consumers. Preliminary findings suggest that consumers with high power distance belief are more likely to engage in satisficing behavior and also exhibit higher levels of psychological distance versus consumers with low power distance belief. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science."

Moreover, the study identifies interactions between social distance, disease acuteness, and message concreteness in relation to donation intentions. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions of how message concreteness affects donation intentions, the study not only contributes to the evolving literature on medical crowdfunding but also responds to scholars' calls for investigating the effects of linguistic styles in diverse contexts.

We also include an analysis of investor characteristics and find that communication of ‘short-term achieve’ investments attracts particularly risk-tolerant and sensation-seeking individuals, posing questions of responsibility towards potentially vulnerable groups. We also find that negative attitudes towards finance may be troublesome, as they can stop individuals from engaging with ‘long-term’ investment products. Positive attitudes towards finance, in contrast, lead investors to engage with ‘protect’ products of both ‘short-’ and ‘long-term’ horizon, highlighting benefits for individuals and society from interventions aimed at financial education and exposure.

Contrary to the early enthusiasm among practitioners for retargeting advertisement, several insights signal that retargeting might not always worth its higher costs (Lambrecht and Tucker 2013). To the best of our knowledge, there are few scientific studies about the effectiveness of retargeting advertisement on consumers’ behavior, in particular on their price perceptions. In this study, we try to address the abovementioned gap by investigating the effect of retargeting advertisement on consumers’ willingness-to-pay. Particularly, in Experiment 1, we compare the effect of price stimuli in the ads which consumers are exposed to at either the early or late stages of decision-making. On the basis construal level theory (Trope et al. 2007), we suggest that exposing to an ad at the early stages of decision making (vs. late stages) have a bigger effect on consumers’ willingness-to-pay. In Experiment 2, on the basis of assimilation-contrast theory (Sherif and Hovland 1961), our goal is to compare the moderating effects of the overlap between the advertised product and consumers’ preferences at early and late search on the effects of price stimuli on willingness-to-pay. We suggest that the effect of the price in the ads on consumers’ willingness-to-pay is directly related to the extent to which the advertised product fits consumers’ preferences. This relationship is more profound in the later stages of decision-making than the early stages. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

However, seldom research examines how consumers process CSR information from the perspective of construal level theory (CLT). Based on CLT, this research conducts a 2 (spatial distance) × 2 (social distance) × 2 (thinking style) between-subject experiment to examine the joint effects of psychological distances of a negative CSR event and consumers’ thinking styles (abstract versus concrete) on their CSR image deteriorations toward the company. The results indicate that negative CSR events in both far and near countries equally worsen CSR image. Furthermore, spatial distance and social distance of the negative CSR event interact to influence CSR image deterioration. Less image deterioration due to closer social distance toward the company is more salient when negative CSR events occur in a home country than in a foreign country. Moreover, when consumer’s thinking style is more often at an abstract level, the negative CSR event occurring in foreign country, compared to that in home country, results in higher CSR image deterioration. Based on the findings, this study suggests companies avoid negative CSR events even in a foreign country as negative CSR events in spatial distance still worsen the CSR image of the company. In addition, companies can shield the damage of negative CSR events by building better relationships with consumers in home country because consumers with supportive attitudes toward the company tend to generate counterarguments toward negative events when the events occur in a familiar environment. Finally, since CSR image deterioration is high when there is a match between the spatial distance of the negative CSR event and the construal level of consumer’s thinking style, companies can lower the impacts of negative CSR event by making it less fit to consumers’ construal level. Companies may communicate negative CSR events occurring in remote countries with a more concrete way while in home country with a more abstract way. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

A critical distinction between intention and actual switching is that the former is a response to a hypothetical situation, whereas the latter is an action that is actually carried out. Recent research on construal level theory (CLT, see Trope and Liberman 2007 for a review) shows that when an event feels psychologically far away (e.g., when the event is hypothetical), people tend to focus on “central” aspects of the event – i.e., aspects that give direct implications to the desirability of the event. According to CLT, these aspects constitute the “higher level construal” of the event. On the other hand, when an event feels psychologically near (e.g., when it is going to happen in the near future), people tend to focus on aspects that are associated with the procedures involved in carrying out the action (e.g., practicality, feasibility considerations). These aspects constitute the “lower level construal” of an event. We first show empirical evidence that monetary incentives, compared with non-monetary switching costs, have a stronger influence on repurchase intent. Non-monetary switching costs, however, play a significantly more important role in determining actual switching behavior. We then conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate how the construal level theory explains this discrepancy. More specifically, we show that monetary incentives constitute a higher level construal, whereas non-monetary switching costs constitute a lower level construal. Moreover, based on recent findings that process simulation (i.e., asking respondents to visualize the step-by-step process of carrying out a certain action) can highlight feasibility aspects of an event and encourages a lower level construal of the event, we suggest that process simulation can be employed in surveys for reducing the inconsistency between responses to intention measures and actual switching behaviors. In one experiment, we recruited participants for an online marketing survey. Participants first registered for an easy, short survey that would take place few weeks later. A few days after the registration, they were contacted and informed that another survey that was more difficult and longer but with a higher payoff was also available to them. They were asked to indicate their intention to switch from the low-effort, low-payoff survey to the high-effort, high-payoff option. To evaluate the extent to which process simulation reduces inconsistency between intention measures and actual behavior, we also administered a “process simulation” condition, in which participants were instructed to imagine going through the survey step-by-step (i.e., to simulate the process) before they indicate their switching intention. Finally, the online survey was open to participants, where they actually decided whether to switch or not, and completed the survey they chose. Our finding showed that process simulation lowered the intention to switch and reduced the inconsistency between switching intention and actual switching behavior. The result supported our prediction. We replicated this finding in another experiment, where participants indicated their intention to attend a paid lab study. Again, for half of the participants, they thought about the steps in the procedures before indicating their intentions. Our finding showed that process simulation made people consider the feasibility issues, such as time and effort to travel to lab, so that their indication is a better predictor of their actual behavior. Our findings suggest the possibility of an unobtrusive administration of procedure simulation in surveys that will improve the predictive power of intention measures of actual switching behavior. These findings have potential applications beyond the immediate switching behavior application to any intent-actual behavior measurement context. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science."

Current trends indicate that internet-enabled markets play a pivotal role in a firm’s revenue generation. The alignment of the customer’s perceived value (i.e., value to customers) and firm value (i.e., value from customers) is also of extreme importance in creating consumer value, consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and a firm’s ultimate profitability (Kumar and Reinartz 2016). Thus, it is time to investigate the interaction among consumer self-construal level, consumer involvement, and firm resources in the context of internet-enabled markets. Extant research suggests that the proliferation of online markets where millions of sellers and buyers exchange with each other is mainly supported by websites run by third-party companies (such as Singh and Kundu 2002). It is through websites that, regardless of actual resources owned (limited or adequate), individual sellers (i.e., one-person seller) compete with their firm counterparts, and unknown sellers (i.e., entrepreneurs, small brands) compete with well-known sellers (i.e., famous brands) or even with big companies. All firms have limited resources; only those that can effectively allocate these resources will achieve profitability and sustainability. To this end, firms must adopt appropriate strategies and develop the corresponding marketing tools in order to enhance consumer engagement. It is our interest to study the strategic implication stemming from the dynamics among consumer self-construal level, consumer involvement with a website, and firm resources of sellers on the website. Notably, our initial assumptions that drive this paper are (1) that consumer self-construal level affects consumers’ information processing of sellers and products; (2) that consumer involvement with a website does not indicate consumer involvement with any sellers on the website, given there are millions of substitutes; and (3) that outperforming firms/individuals compete with their counterparts by successful manipulation of marketing strategies that are contingent on their products, resources, and consumer characteristics. We develop our propositions by drawing on the construal-level theory, literature on consumer involvement, and the resource-based perspective. Enabled by contemporary technology and marketing analytics, we argue that hypotheses could be further developed from our propositions and could be tested using real-time behavioral data pulled from third-party platforms (such as amazon.com), data from complementary surveys, and interviews of sellers on these platforms. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Strategy variations include emphasizing the desirability (rationale for climate change goals) or feasibility (means to achieve these goals) features. We experimentally examine whether and how these framing features and the investment horizon jointly affect investors’ judgments. Drawing on construal level theory, we find that short-term investors are significantly more willing to invest when a company’s disclosures emphasize feasibility over desirability features. In contrast, long-term investors exhibit no significant difference in willingness to invest, regardless of the framing features in these disclosures. We find that feelings of fluency in processing the information drive the effect of feasibility features on short-term investors’ willingness to invest. This feeling, in turn, enhances perceived management communicative competence, increasing short-term investors’ willingness to invest. We also conduct supplementary experiments to rule out the influence of the firm’s operating performance and the positivity of the news between the framing features on these results.

Based on construal level theory, we argue that expectations about one's long-term networks reflect perceptions of the stable nature of one's current networks. A 4-wave study with two samples of newcomers in diverse Chinese organizations found that institutionalized socialization predicted positive development in the size of newcomers' current and expected networks, which in turn predicted managers' ratings of newcomers' in-role performance and extra-role behaviors in the form of altruistic helping and taking charge.

As such, firms or individuals that use the internet to pursue opportunities, whether they market their offerings domestically or internationally, have the potential to become instant born-globals that derive significant competitive advantages from the use of resources and the sales of offerings in multiple countries (Oviatt and McDougall 1994, 2005; Yamin and Sinkovics 2006; Chandra and Coviello 2010). Previous research argues that born-globals compete by their strengths in mobilizing and utilizing different resources instead of by the amount of resources owned (Knight and Cavusgil 2004; Cavusgil and Knight 2015). It is through the internet-enabled market that, regardless of the location and the actual amount of resources, individual sellers compete with their firm counterparts, and small, unknown sellers compete with more famous brands. For sellers who lack resources, capitalizing on the knowledge of their consumers is often the most effective way to remain in business, because interactions with consumers are limited due to the online nature. Therefore, if limited-resource companies can correctly interpret their consumers’ behaviors, they can remain in competition with much larger firms. Extant consumer research has investigated consumers’ regulatory foci and their construal levels extensively; yet a dearth of studies examine their interaction, especially in the context of internet-enabled markets. With more research conducted in this stream, sellers can acquire more updated knowledge about their consumers. They can also allocate their limited resources effectively by developing appropriate marketing messages that enhance consumer engagement, which could eventually contribute to their profitability and sustainability (Harmeling et al. 2017). Drawing on Regulatory Focus Theory and Construal Level Theory, we develop testable propositions to fill the gap in the literature and managerial strategy. It is our interest to generate strategic marketing implications stemming from the interaction between the regulatory foci and construal levels of consumers in the context of internet-enabled markets. Notably, the premises of this paper are as follows. (1) Consumers with different regulatory foci are likely to buy from different sellers. (2) Consumers with different construal levels process information of sellers, products, and marketing messages differently. (3) Sellers, who successfully manipulate their marketing messages that are contingent on their consumers’ characteristics, are more likely to out-compete their counterparts in the global market. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Across five experiments, trade-offs are implied and explicitly made salient, and construal levels are manipulated by altering temporal distance and perceptual fluency, and by using a well-established cognitive method. Consistent with prior research, we demonstrate that higher construal levels can reduce anticipated unethical behavior, when trade-offs are not salient, by making higher-level moral values more prominent. When trade-offs are salient, however, we reveal that unethical behavior is increased when construal levels are elevated by making desirability-related thoughts relatively more prominent, compared to feasibility-related thoughts. Tests of mediation provide support for the role of desirability- and feasibility-related thoughts. Together, our results provide insight into the opposing predictions made by construal level theory for ethical decision making by revealing how trade-off salience, often inherent in ethical dilemmas, systematically influences the effects of construal level on ethical decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Often corporations make such contributions in exchange for the right to affiliate with the sponsored event or organization. Sponsorship is thus regarded as a marketing communication instrument. Besides communicating via sponsorship, sponsors and sponsored entities also communicate about a sponsorship. Such “sponsorship-linked marketing” is especially common when announcing the initiation of a sponsorship. In this context, one challenge is how best to communicate the relationship created via corporate sponsorships. However, research on the influence of sponsorship announcements has uncovered mixed results and suffers from two shortcomings. First, previous studies have only considered the announcement of sponsorships at a generic level, while ignoring the potential for variation in how a sponsorship is publicly announced (i.e., the composition of announcements). Second, scholars have emphasized investors’ reaction to announcements while overlooking any potential effects on consumers, who are a more likely target for sponsorship communication. In the present study, we therefore investigate how different types of sponsorship announcements influence consumers’ perceptions of the sponsoring firm. Specifically, based on Construal Level Theory (CLT), we conducted the first of a series of experiments to investigate how the concreteness of the information contained in an announcement influences consumers’ responses to the sponsorship. Construal level theory suggests that individuals evaluate information with different degrees of abstraction. High-level construals are simple mental representations and only extract the most important available information from a situation. These construals consist of general features of the event, and thus deemphasize unique and detailed features. Meanwhile, low-level construals tend to be more concrete and contextualized features of the event. While low-level construals are richer and more detailed, they are also less structured and less parsimonious than high-level construals. Moreover, CLT suggests that individuals differ in their mental construction of identical information, known as Personal Level of Construal (PLC). To meet our purpose of understanding how sponsorship announcements influence consumers, we apply CLT to the information content of announcements. We assess the impact of individuals’ construal predisposition to abstract (high-level) or concrete (low-level) mental construction and derive three hypotheses about the effects of different levels of information construal in communication about sponsorships. Specifically, we anticipate that overall, an announcement containing more concrete details about a sponsorship (i.e., low levels of construal) will result in more positive outcomes for both the sponsoring brand (H1) and sponsored event (H2) when compared to a more abstract announcement. Moreover, we predict an interaction effect between the construal level of the sponsorship announcement and respondents’ PLC (H3). This proposition is based on the idea that whether or not information presented about a sponsorship matches the individual’s PLC will influence the extent of information processing, with mismatches sparking more extensive processing. We thus assume that consumers with a high (low) PLC will evaluate the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event more (less) positive when faced with a concrete sponsorship announcement than when faced with an abstract sponsorship announcement. To test the proposed hypotheses we conducted an experiment that manipulated the construal level of a sponsorship announcement (abstract/concrete) between subjects. Results indicate that an announcement of a lower construal level (i.e., more concrete) leads to more positive evaluations of both the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event, thereby supporting hypotheses H1 and H2. Regarding the hypothesized interaction effect, for abstract thinkers, concrete announcements did indeed lead to a more positive attitude toward the sponsor, a higher trust in the sponsor, a higher willingness to recommend the sponsor, and a higher purchase intention of the sponsor, as well as a more positive attitude toward the sponsored event and a higher trust in the sponsored event, thereby supporting H3. Concrete thinkers’ evaluation of the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event, however, did not show any significant differences based on the construal level of the announcement. This finding requires further consideration of concrete thinkers’ processing of information at different levels of abstraction. The results of this first experiment demonstrate the relevance of considering CLT in sponsorship-linked communications. Presenting content at a low level construal is preferable to more abstract information. The findings in this initial study also suggest that individuals interpreting the concrete announcements with a higher level construal react more favorably toward the sponsoring brand and, to some extent, the sponsored event as well. As a result, manipulating an individual’s construal level (through temporal or social distance) could be useful for marketers engaged in sponsorship communications. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science."

Salespeople are the external face of an organization and must communicate firm values in an innovative fashion on a customer-by-customer basis (Raymond and Tanner 1994). They work to proactively find new customers and grow existing accounts (Raymond and Tanner 1994). Additionally, salespeople face immense uncertainty and risk regarding their successes in closing business and, subsequently, their financial remuneration (Boichuk et al. 2014). These job characteristics are similar to those faced by entrepreneurs and are thus closely related to the concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO), defined as a propensity to be innovative, proactive, and open to taking constructive risks (Avlonitis and Salavou 2007). The concept of EO has traditionally been applied at the organizational level. Research indicates that certain organizations are more entrepreneurial than others and that in general, EO positively influences firm-level performance (Lumpkin and Dess 1996). Recently, the concept of individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) has been introduced to the entrepreneurship literature (Bolton 2012; Ferreira et al. 2015). Similar to research on organizational EO, findings suggest that individual entrepreneurs who are innovative, proactive, and risk taking (i.e., high in IEO) tend to be more successful (e.g., Bolton 2012; Gupta et al. 2015). Researchers, however, have yet to investigate IEO in the sales context. The purpose of this project, then, is to study the role IEO plays in predicting salesperson success. Based on the outlined research gap, we develop and empirically test a model that examines the effect of a salesperson’s IEO on sales performance. While studies on organizational EO examined the role of companies’ handling of information and knowledge (e.g., Sciascia et al. 2014; Wales et al. 2013), we consider this aspect on the individual level by proposing that salespeople who think abstractly (vs. concretely) will be more entrepreneurial and that this IEO will positively impact sales performance. This paper contributes to the existing literature by introducing the concept of IEO to a model of salesperson performance, as little research has linked entrepreneurial orientation to salesperson performance.

Two studies provide robust evidence that self-transcendence values mitigate counterfeit patronage when consumers’ counterfeit experience is low.

However, traditional on-site, physical DT sessions are increasingly replaced by virtual sessions, potentially undermining the experiential nature of DT. This study examines the effects of changing from a physical to a virtual format on participants' experiences in DT processes as well as the resulting outcomes. To this end, we first identified two established complementary psychological theories—construal level theory and embodied cognition—that provide starting points for understanding the experiences of participants in physical and virtual DT formats. Next, we pursued an exploratory qualitative study by conducting 41 in-depth interviews with DT experts from research and practice. Our findings show that the DT format has profound effects across all phases of the DT process. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute by showing that changing the DT format to a virtual setting affects participants' cognitive experiences during all DT process phases and the respective outcomes.

Investigations of failures consistently highlight how key employees behaved in (perhaps unintentionally) unethical ways that de-prioritized safety, such as investing fewer resources in safety (vs. other priorities) over time. Drawing on these investigations, we suggest a previously underexplored theme could explain why organizational failures persist and why employees did not “see” the potential for their behaviors to cause harm to others: Employees were distanced from where the harm eventually occurred, either in terms of space (e.g., being located miles away from the job site) or time (e.g., making decisions that would not have impacts for months or years). We use construal level theory to investigate how the way employees construe where work occurs—defined as work context construal—influences perceptions of harm and the ethical framing of risk-mitigating behaviors. We hypothesize that high-level (abstract) work context construals (vs. low-level, concrete ones) reduce perceptions of potential harm which, in turn, leads to framing risk-mitigating behaviors as less of an ethical obligation. Six studies—a correlational survey of aviation employees (Study 1), field experiments with offshore drilling employees (Study 2A) and health care workers (Study 2B), a preregistered experiment with nurses (Study 3), and two supplemental studies (Studies 4A/B)—support our hypotheses.

Given the rise in non-physicality of products and consumers' increasing participation in peer-to-peer markets, this research examines the relationship between non-physicality of goods and disparities in seller–buyer valuations, a critical component of market inefficiencies. In a meta-analysis of 598 observations across 129 articles, the authors find that non-physical (vs. physical) goods have significantly larger seller–buyer valuation disparities (i.e., larger endowment effects). This pattern is consistent across non-physical categories, including market and non-market goods. The authors argue the immateriality of non-physical goods reduces evaluability and enhances perceived complexity, leading to greater asymmetries in information processing between sellers and buyers. Congruent with construal level theory, marketing tactics associated with low categorization levels (emphasizing product features) influence consumer valuations of physical goods, but not non-physical goods. Instead, consumer valuations of non-physical goods are asymmetrically influenced by tactics with high categorization levels (accentuating collective identity).

The goal of this research is to understand how psychological distances can influence the perceptions of consumers toward organization’s decisions in ambivalent situations. We examine such responses from the view of consumers and rely on Construal Level Theory (CLT) to inform and predict possible outcomes. Their actions, which can often send mixed messages, indicate ambivalence depending on whether they convey morality or competence efforts more. It is important, through the lenses of CLT, to examine how psychological distance formed from messaging can influence how consumers perceive an organization’s level of competence or morality. We investigate the perspectives and evaluations of consumers regarding ambivalence acts of an organization based on spatial distance (near vs. far). A between subject’s behavioral experiment design was used and we randomly assigned participants to one of the two different spatial conditions, near or far. Participants read about the ambivalent situation we created regarding the university’s decision during COVID-19 and were randomly assigned to either competence ambivalent or morality ambivalent. We demonstrate that this can result in varying customer perceptions toward the organization. Our findings show that customers at a distance (far spatial distance) will value the moral decisions made by the organization more than its level of competency. Whereas there was no significant difference when customers are local (near spatial distance). Our results suggest that in order to be perceived more positively and increase customer satisfaction levels, organizations should take morality based actions over competence based actions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

We apply the construal level theory (CLT) to examine how marketers can encourage more sustainable consumption behaviors through message framing. Construal Level Theory (CLT) suggests that people construe the same persuasive information differently depending on the construal level or psychological distance (Trope and Liberman 2010). Actions can be viewed at varying levels of abstraction, from low levels (concrete), specifying how the action is performed, to high levels (abstract), specifying why it is performed (Freitas et al. 2004). Previous studies have found that consumers process information more efficiently when there is congruence between the portrayed distance and the message (Stewart and Nandkeolyar 2006). We report experiments situated in two distinct consumption contexts, namely green hotel decision making and sustainable food choices. In the green hotel decision making study, we implemented a 2 (temporal distance: impending hotel stay vs. future hotel stay) × 2 (benefits: low/high construal level) between-subjects experimental research design. Participants imagined a future out-of-town trip that required booking a green hotel room. Temporal distance manipulation was implemented by having participants consider a trip for the upcoming spring break (near; concrete) or the following year (far; abstract). Participants then viewed an advertisement for a green hotel, which contained one of two advertising messages: first focusing on personal benefit, sleeping on organic and biodegradable mattresses (concrete), and another emphasizing an environmental benefit framed as helping reduce climate change (abstract). Initial findings indicate that when the consumption event is far (i.e., future hotel stay), expected satisfaction is higher when the attributes of the service are presented as abstract (i.e., an environmental benefit; high construal) rather than a concrete (i.e., a personal benefit; low construal). To further investigate the impact of construal levels in messaging, we extend construal levels in terms of social distance and implement experiments in the context of sustainable food decisions. A similar between-subject study will investigate how consumption decisions are influenced when respondents think about their immediate family (concrete; low construal) or society (abstract; high construal) and sustainable consumption benefits are framed in terms of personal health (concrete; low construal) or environmental benefits (abstract; high construal). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Loewenstein (1996) explains the superiority of the products presented in reality by the fact that the presentation’s sensory richness increases vividness. Thus, shoppers experience the gratification arising from consuming the more intensively presented products in reality than concerning a symbolic presentation, which is supposed to lead to a higher buying impulse. In fact, especially in the context of online shopping, studies show that a higher vividness is accompanied by a greater intention to buy (Steinmann et al. 2014). Bushong et al. (2010) therefore advise dealers to exclusively present real products. As far as retailers are concerned, however, sometimes practical reasons determine the favour for the products’ symbolic presentation: when presenting razor blades, retailers, for example, often use pictures to protect against theft. The construal level theory (CLT) suggests that dealers do not necessarily always have to be wrong in using the symbolic presentation: research concerning the CLT demonstrates that the construal level influences the information underlying a decision (Trope et al. 2007). Accordingly, a high construal level is accompanied by the use of abstract global information and low-order cognitions such as is achieved by the more vivid presentation of the real product. Opposed to this, a low construal level indicates the use of concrete detailed representations such as they result from symbolic presentations by photographs. This influence renders it likely that the effect of vividness on the purchase decision is impacted by the construal level. There is, however, no empirical evidence concerning this assumption so far. In our study, we assume that purchase decisions based on abstract, global information as far as high construal levels are concerned and that, hence, products exhibiting a higher vividness are preferentially purchased. In contrast, rather concrete, detailed information is used as far as low construal levels are concerned which is why those products are to be preferentially purchased that are presented in a more symbolic way. Such findings would contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive processes underlying the buying decision process and would help define the conditions in which a more vivid or a more symbolic product presentation is more likely to be used in a shopping context. We test our assumption in three experiments in which we vary the construal level and the vividness in different product categories and environments: in study 1 (laboratory and student sample) and study 2 (real purchase environment and customers of a perfumery), we manipulate the construal level by a procedure inspired by Fujita et al. (2006) and test the effect of cosmetics presented in reality vs. those presented symbolically. In study 3 we manipulate the construal level by a different temporal distance to the product (Trope et al. 2007) and transfer the results to another product category, namely, to chocolate. The results of threes studies with different product categories and in different environments suggest that vividness has an effect on the purchase intention but that this effect is moderated by the construal level. As expected, we found a direct effect of vividness on the consumers’ purchase intention. This result replicates the findings of prior research that successfully demonstrated the stable effect of a higher vividness on the purchase intention. It is assumed that the presentation richer in sensory enables the experience of gratification in the consumption situation more easily and that thus the product alternative presented in a more vivid way is preferred in the purchase decision. Our results, however, also show that this effect is moderated by the level of construal: A vivid product presentation leads to a higher purchase intention only for a high level construal. For a low level of construal, a symbolic presentation leads to a higher purchase intention. These results have implications for shopper marketing. Even if a high vividness of product presentation principally appears helpful in individual cases, it is more useful for dealers to prefer, for instance, product illustrations to the presentation of real products. In this case, our findings suggest to either position the products in a way that a low level of construal is likely or to reduce the construal level as much as possible. The former can, for example, occur at the cash desk where consumption time and purchase decision lie temporally closer together. The latter takes place for instance by means of spatial proximity or by the highlighting of goal-irrelevant features (vs. goal-relevant features, Trope et al. 2007). Furthermore, there are situations in which consumption time and purchase decision temporally and spatially lie close together and hence one can assume a low level of mental construal. For example, such a case is likely concerning chocolate bars at the supermarket checkout or concerning the ordering in a fast food restaurant. In these settings, symbolic product presentations, e.g. by means of a photograph, support the purchase decision in a better way than vivid presentations, e.g. by means of a real product example.

Combining system justification and construal level theory, a politically identifiable segment of consumers is argued to counter this effect. Because individuals with a conservative (vs. liberal) political orientation tend to justify systemic processes, they are more likely to trust sponsored versus organic marketing communications. Across four studies (secondary data, surveys, online field experiment), conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to click on search ads because they perceive them as more trustworthy. This relationship is most prevalent when consumers conduct broad searches, activating an abstract search construal that relies on a thinking style consistent with one’s core ideological beliefs and values. However, both conservatives and liberals are equally likely to click on search ads when they conduct more specific searches, activating a concrete search construal that enables a thinking style that is context-dependent and therefore diverges from one’s core beliefs and values. © Copyright © 2024, American Academy of Advertising."

Firms seeking international presence and opportunities for expansion need to take strategic decisions regarding the degree of adaptation of their marketing mix in their business arrangements in the host country. Specifically, price adaptation, relative to the other elements of the international marketing mix, has received the least attention in international marketing studies, despite having a fundamental role in the marketing program. Some possible explanations to the lack of research attention include the dearth of appropriate and sophisticated theoretical international pricing frameworks, the heterogenous nature of pricing, and the downgrade of its importance. This study investigates whether, how and under what conditions psychic distance affects managers’ decisions regarding international marketing adaptation strategies. Drawing on the construal level theory, we develop a model that suggests promotion orientation and cognitive style as the boundary conditions, and construal level mindset as the underlying mediating mechanism of this effect. Using an experimental vignette study with 233 export managers from originating from analytic (Greece) and holistic (Taiwan) cognitive style markets we find that psychic distance has a significant positive effect on price adaptation, but that this effect is attenuated among managers with a more holistic cognitive style. Results further reveal that the positive effect of psychic distance becomes weaker when managers are characterized by higher promotion orientation and confirm that construal level mindset mediates the effect of psychic distance on adaptation decisions. The article contributes to the international marketing literature by uncovering boundary conditions and an underlying mechanism for the effects of psychic distance. Moreover, results provide important managerial implications for business strategic planning, cross border strategy, recruitment and training. Finally, rich intercultural insights are offered which will encourage researchers to further investigate the global applicability of mindset in international marketing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

A manner in which immigrants can be transported back to their home country is through consumption of nostalgic cultural brands. Their memories are a way to reconnect with their home country (Bray 2014; Fujita et al. 2006). Nostalgia oftentimes serves as a strong driver in their decision-making when choosing products (Guzman and Paswan 2009; Sierra and McQuitty 2007). Nostalgia is defined as a “preference toward objects from when one was younger or from times about which one has learned vicariously perhaps through socialization or media” (Fairley 2003). Guzman et al. (2009) proved that immigrants have higher affinity toward home country products in contrast to those living in their home country. Moreover, we infer that immigrants, in regard to nostalgic products, have a stronger desire for products depending on the psychological distance to their home country. Psychological distance refers to the manner in which we think about particular situations, high- vs low- construal levels (Klaus 2007). Thus, drawing on CLT, the objective of this article is to explore the role that psychological distance (temporal-, spatial-, social-, and hypothetical-distance) plays on the relationship between nostalgic cultural brands and purchase intentions. Given the diverse demographics of the United States, it is an ideal conduit for immigrant data collection. Statistically, the USA receives a large number of immigrants both in sheer volume and variety. Our general hypothesis states (H1): The relationship between nostalgic cultural brands and purchase intentions is positive, such that nostalgic cultural brands will lead to higher purchase intentions among immigrant consumers. Primary research to be conducted in both survey method and focus groups to gather immigrant emotions toward and perceptions of home and host country, reaction to nostalgic cultural brands, and the motivation of purchasing the products of nostalgic cultural brands. As immigration is a natural experience in the modern day, understanding immigrants better is critical for the success of nostalgic cultural brands. Knowledge of immigrant purchase intentions allows for more refined marketing techniques (i.e., segmenting, targeting, and positioning). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science."

Construal level theory has been extensively used to explain the effect of psychological distance on evaluation, prediction, and behavior (Trope et al., 2007). Psychological distance is defined as “the subjective distance between an actor and an event in the actor’s psychological space (Kim et al., 2008).” This multidimensional construct includes temporal distance, social distance, spatial distance, and hypotheticality (Liberman et al., 2007). Social distance and spatial distance are two dimensions that have been studied independently in previous literature. The author hypothesizes that the interaction effect of social distance and spatial distance on consumers’ evaluation varies from Western culture to Eastern culture. Moreover, this study intends to offer insights into the use of construal level theory in tourism advertising. Destinations targeting visitors from different cultures might adjust their marketing communications to be appealing. In conjunction with the tourism context, this research reviews the effects of two psychological distance dimensions, social distance and spatial distance, and the potential moderating effect of culture on customers’ attitudes and behavior intention. A 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design is purposed to test the hypotheses. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science."
